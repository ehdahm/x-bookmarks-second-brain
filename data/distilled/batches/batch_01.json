If the model is right, the code writes itself. \n\nSimulate the system until time disappears. Every edge case must already be resolved in thought. If you feel momentum, stop.

It passes the vibe check with flying colors. It matches my writing at 85-93%. I added a Claude Max account to my Team account just to use it more (and because Anthropic hates Team users). Downsides are that it runs out of context fast and that it jumps to action (like making a slide deck) too often when I don't want it to. \n\n2) Daily doer: Claude Code - I feel like a powerful conductor, wielding multiple terminals, building anything that pops into my mind, morphing my computer into the right interface at the right time. Mostly a terminal user, but will eventually go into Chrome more.\n\n3) Long tasks with lots of context: Google Gemini 3 Pro/NotebookLM - I remain obsessed with NotebookLM and love that it takes in links. I regularly upload YouTube links to those 2h or 4h long podcasts and 'talk' to the podcast guest. 200K tokens in Claude and ChatGPT just runs out too fast.\n\n4) Image anything - Nano Banana Pro. Holy cow. I made a fun PPT for my team and used NBP to make every single dynamic slide background. Infographics are the best, even with a few text issues. Would not call it enterprise-grade due to text inconsistencies. \n\n5) Video - tie between Sora and Veo 3, with Veo 3 slightly ahead. This is not a common use case for me. Really just to make memes. I prioritize convenience very highly here, and the Sora app is easy. I don't scroll the Sora app, however. Used it for 3 days and stopped. Maybe I'm not the right demographic. \n\n6) Voice anything - Whisper API, followed by Wispr Flow and Otter AI tied for second. Gemini a distant third. Anthropic fading into the deep darkness in fourth and forgotten place. Siri buried under the floorboards.\n\n7) Talking to multiple documents - NotebookLM\n\n8) Extra efficiency hacks - Claude Skills, Claude brain dump folder for terminal comms, Wispr Flow into multiple CC terminals, Stream Deck with AI shortcuts, prompt text replacement shortcuts, Oculus Quest headset for extra focus, airplane mode, blue light blocking glasses, headlamp (I know that last one sounds insane)",

It's not relevant if you're making another CRUD program in React or a TODO list, but if you're doing something pretty complicated in Rust or Golang, or something involving complex data, this approach is almost scary in what it can do. \n\nIt's a 2-round process. Here is Round 1:\n\n---\n\nFirst read ALL of the AGENTS dot md file and README dot md file super carefully and understand ALL of both! Then use your code investigation agent mode to fully understand the code, and technical architecture and purpose of the project. \n\nThen, once you've done an extremely thorough and meticulous job at all that and deeply understood the entire existing system and what it does, its purpose, and how it is implemented and how all the pieces connect with each other, I need you to hyper-intensively investigate and study and ruminate on these questions as they pertain to this project: \n\nAre there any other gross inefficiencies in the core system? places in the code base where 1) changes would actually move the needle in terms of overall latency/responsiveness and throughput; 2) such that our changes would be provably isomorphic in terms of functionality so that we would know for sure that it wouldn't change the resulting outputs given the same inputs; 3) where you have a clear vision to an obviously better approach in terms of algorithms or data structures (note that for this, you can include in your contemplations lesser-known data structures and more esoteric/sophisticated/mathematical algorithms as well as ways to recast the problem(s) so that another paradigm is exposed, such as the list shown below (Note: Before proposing any optimization, establish baseline metrics (p50/p95/p99 latency, throughput, peak memory) and capture CPU/allocation/I/O profiles to identify actual hotspots):\n\n- N+1 query/fetch pattern elimination\n- zero-copy / buffer reuse / scatter-gather I/O\n- serialization format costs (parse/encode overhead)\n- bounded queues + backpressure (prevent memory blowup and tail latency)\n- sharding / striped locks to reduce contention\n- memoization with cache invalidation strategies\n- dynamic programming techniques\n- convex optimization theory\n- lazy evaluation / deferred computation\n- iterator/generator patterns to avoid materializing large collections\n- streaming/chunked processing for memory-bounded work\n- pre-computation and lookup tables\n- index-based lookup vs linear scan recognition\n- binary search (on data and on answer space)\n- two-pointer and sliding window techniques\n- prefix sums / cumulative aggregates\n- topological sort and DAG-awareness for dependency graphs\n- cycle detection\n- union-find for dynamic connectivity\n- graph traversal (BFS/DFS) with early termination\n- Dijkstra's / A* for weighted shortest paths\n- priority queues / heaps\n- tries for prefix operations\n- bloom filters for probabilistic membership\n- interval/segment trees for range queries\n- spatial indexing (k-d trees, quadtrees, R-trees)\n- persistent/immutable data structures\n- copy-on-write semantics\n- object/connection pooling\n- cache eviction policy selection (LRU/LFU/ARC)\n- batch-aware algorithm selection\n- async I/O batching and coalescing\n- lock-free structures for high-contention scenarios\n- work-stealing for recursive parallelism\n- memory layout optimization (SoA vs AoS, cache locality)\n- short-circuiting and early termination\n- string interning for repeated values\n- amortized analysis reasoning\n\ntaking into consideration these general guides where applicable:\n\nDP APPLICABILITY CHECKS:\n- Overlapping subproblems? \u2192 memoize with stable state key\n- Optimal partitioning/batching? \u2192 prefix sums + interval DP\n- Dependency graph with repeated traversal? \u2192 single-pass topological DP\n\nCONVEX OPTIMIZATION CHECKS:\n- Brute-forcing exact allocation/scheduling? \u2192 LP / min-cost flow with deterministic tie-breaking\n- Continuous parameter fitting with explicit loss? \u2192 regularized least squares / QP\n- Large decomposable convex objective? \u2192 ADMM / proximal methods\n\nAlso note that if there are well-written third party libraries you know of that would work well, we can include them in the project). \n\nMETHODOLOGY REQUIREMENTS:\n\nA) Baseline first: Run the test suite and a representative workload; record p50/p95/p99 latency, throughput, and peak memory with exact commands.\n\nB) Profile before proposing: Capture CPU + allocation + I/O profiles; identify the top 3\u20135 hotspots by % time before suggesting changes.\n\nC) Equivalence oracle: Define explicit golden outputs + invariants. For large input spaces, add property-based or metamorphic tests.\n\nD) Isomorphism proof per change: Every proposed diff must include a short proof sketch explaining why outputs cannot change (including ordering, tie-breaking, floating-point behavior, and RNG seeds).\n\nE) Opportunity matrix: Rank candidates by (Impact \u00d7 Confidence) / Effort before implementing; focus only on items likely to move p95+ or throughput meaningfully.\n\nF) Minimal diffs: One performance lever per change. No unrelated refactors. Include rollback guidance if any risk exists.\n\nG) Regression guardrails: Add benchmark thresholds or monitoring hooks to prevent future regressions.\n\nUse ultrathink.\n\n---\n\nYou can run that once in Claude Code with Opus 4.5 and once in Codex with GPT 5.2 Codex (I started using just High because Extra High is just too slow for me unless I'm about to go to bed). \n\nAfter they finish, hit them each with like 5 quick rounds of this one:\n\n\"Great. Look over everything again for any obvious oversights or omissions or mistakes, conceptual errors, blunders, etc. Use ultrathink\"\n\nThen have them save the outputs like this:\n\n\"OK, save all of that as PLAN_FOR_ADVANCED_OPTIMIZATIONS_ROUND_1__OPUS.md\"\n\n\"OK, save all of that as PLAN_FOR_ADVANCED_OPTIMIZATIONS_ROUND_1__GPT.md\"\n\nThen in Claude Code, do:\n\n\"Compare what you did to PLAN_FOR_ADVANCED_OPTIMIZATIONS_ROUND_1__GPT.md and take the best elements from that and weave them into your plan to get a hybrid best of both worlds superior plan by editing your original plan file in place.\"\n\nThen this:\n\nReread AGENTS dot md so it's still fresh in your mind. Now read ALL of PLAN_FOR_ADVANCED_OPTIMIZATIONS_ROUND_1__OPUS.md. Then check over each bead super carefully-- are you sure it makes sense? Is it optimal? Could we change anything to make the system work better for users? We want a comprehensive and granular set of beads for all   this with tasks, subtasks, and dependency structure overlaid, with detailed comments so that the whole thing is totally self-contained and self-documenting (including relevant background, reasoning/justification, considerations, etc.-- anything we'd want our \"future self\" to know about the goals and intentions and thought process   and how it serves the over-arching goals of the project.). The beads should be so detailed that we never need to consult back to the original markdown plan document. Does it accurately reflect ALL of the markdown plan file in a comprehensive way?   If changes are warranted then revise the beads or create new ones or close invalid or inapplicable ones. It's a lot easier and faster to operate in \"plan space\" before we start implementing these things! DO NOT OVERSIMPLIFY THINGS! DO NOT LOSE ANY FEATURES OR FUNCTIONALITY! Also, make sure that as part of these beads, we include   comprehensive unit tests and e2e test scripts with great, detailed logging so we can be sure that everything is working perfectly after implementation. Remember to ONLY use the `bd` tool to create and modify the beads and to add the dependencies to beads.\"\n\nThen a few rounds of:\n\n\"Check over each bead super carefully-- are you sure it makes sense?

    "note_tweet_text": "Founder of The Browser Company: \u201cIf you don\u2019t work Claude Code-native ASAP your team\u2019s going to get left behind.\u201d\n\nThe \u201cClaude Code-native\u201d thing sounds like a buzzword until you look at what\u2019s actualy happening at top engineering orgs.\n\nBoris Cherny, who created Claude Code at Anthropic, runs 5-10 parallel Claude instances simultaneously while coding. His team pushes around five releases per engineer per day. Jaana Dogan at Google admitted Claude Code generated a distributed system in 60 minutes that her team spent a year iterating on.\n\nThe math on productivity compression is wild.\n\nTraditional dev cycle for a feature\u2026 weeks. Claude Code native teams? Days. Sometimes hours. Ethan Mollick had Claude Code autonomously work for 74 minutes straight building a complete startup website from a single prompt.\n\nMiller\u2019s three hiring principles tell you where this is going.\n\nOne\u2026 Premium pay for people native to this way of building. Not \u201ccan use AI tools.\u201d Native. Meaning the AI is the primary execution layer and the human provides direction, taste, judgment.\n\nTwo\u2026 Treat teammates like artists at a record label. Get them into flow. Keep them in flow. Help more of their ideas ship. This only works if execution friction approaches zero.\n\nThree\u2026 Do fewer things with MORE depth and tolerance for risky bets. You can only operate this way when your velocity is 10x what it was before.\n\nThe mobile native comparison is spot on. Remember when companies were debating whether to build mobile apps? The ones who went mobile-first won. The ones who treated mobile as a nice-to-have got left behind.\n\nSame dynamic playing out now.\n\nBut there\u2019s a harder truth Miller is hinting at.\n\nIf one engineer with Claude Code outputs what previously required a 5-person team\u2026 what happens to headcount planning? The Browser Company already operates with a small team relative to their ambition. Under Atlassian they\u2019re not scaling headcount. They\u2019re scaling output per person.\n\nThis means two things for founders.\n\nFirst\u2026 Your best engineers become worth significantly more. They\u2019re now force multipliers instead of individual contributors. Compensation will reflect this.\n\nSecond\u2026 Your average engineers become a liability. Not because they\u2019re bad. Because they\u2019re not adapting fast enough to the new paradigm.\n\nThe gap between AI-native engineers and everyone else will widen faster than the mobile transition did. We went from \u201cmaybe we should have a mobile site\u201d to \u201cmobile is 60% of traffic\u201d in about four years. I think the Claude Code native transition happens in half that time.\n\nMobile wasn\u2019t optional. Neither is this.",

    "note_tweet_text": "Most PM jobs are, I think, basically performance art. Like, that's not even an exaggeration.\n\nYou ship a feature nobody asked for. You ignore the metrics because leadership never checks them anyway. You wait for the inevitable complaints to roll in. And then you swoop in with a \"fix\" and everyone calls you a hero. Right? That's the loop. Ship, ignore, break, fix, hero. Rinse and repeat and collect your performance review.\n\nI talked to a PM recently who described his entire job this way. And the painful part is he knows exactly what's happening. Stakeholders want features, so he builds features. Nobody looks at whether they work.\nSomething breaks. He fixes it. People clap. That's it. That's the whole thing.\n\n\"Every book I've read on PM seems idealized,\" he said, \"and the reality never seems to align.\"\n\nAnd I think that's because companies adopt the prestigious \"product manager\" title without actually wanting product management. They want the label. They don't want the function. And that's a really, really important distinction.\n\nWhy the loop exists\n\nSo here's the thing. Real product work is threatening.\n\nIt means someone might say \"we shouldn't build that.\" It means research could contradict idea du jour. It means the roadmap becomes a hypothesis instead of a promise, and promises are what get budgets approved and careers protected and all of that stuff.\n\nSo companies just... don't do it. They get the title without the function.\n\nAnd I don't think this is incompetence, I would say it's more like self-protection. The org is working exactly as designed. The PM becomes a buffer, basically. Someone to sit between executives and engineers. Someone to absorb blame when things go wrong and distribute credit when things go right. A translator of requirements into tickets. A project coordinator with a fancier title.\n\nHow to spot it\n\nYou can diagnose this pretty quickly, I think. Just ask yourself a few questions.\n\nWhen research contradicts a stakeholder, does research ever win? Not \"does research get heard\" but does it actually change the outcome?\n\nBecause in these orgs, research exists to validate what's already decided. You go find three user quotes that support the thing leadership wants to build, and you call that discovery. Right?\n\nIs there budget for discovery or just delivery? This one's easy. Look at where the money goes. If every dollar is allocated to building and shipping and none of it is allocated to figuring out what to build, you're in release theater. There's no money for questions. There's only money for answers.\n\nAre you measured on outcomes or output? Features shipped versus problems solved. In release theater, the dashboard counts releases. Nobody tracks whether users are actually better off. Nobody even asks.\n\nAnd here's the real test: can you say \"we shouldn't build this\" and survive? Not theoretically. Actually. If you walked into the next planning meeting and said \"I've looked at this and I don't think we should do it,\" what would happen to you?\n\nMost PMs I know would answer no to all four. Which means your job isn't broken. Your company just doesn't actually want product management. They want someone to run the loop. That's it.\n\nSo there's a way out of release theater but it requires accepting something uncomfortable.\n\nYou might need to leave.\n\nI don't say that lightly. But not every organization can be fixed from within. Some structures exist specifically to resist the kind of thinking real product work requires. The antibodies are too strong. The incentives are too locked in. You can fight it for years and nothing changes and you just burn out. I've seen it happen.\n\nIf you do stay, stop trying to \"be a better PM.\" Stop reading books about discovery frameworks and stakeholder management and all of that stuff. That's optimizing for a game you're not actually playing.\n\nInstead, start mapping who actually decides things. Who can say yes. Who can kill an idea with a raised eyebrow. Sit in meetings and watch where people look when a decision needs to be made. It's usually pretty obvious fairly quickly.\n\nFigure out which two or three cracks exist where research might realistically change an outcome. Work those cracks. Ignore everything else.\n\nIt's not idealized PM work. But it's honest about the constraints. And honestly, I think that might be the most product-minded thing you can do in a release theater org. See the system clearly. Stop pretending it's something it's not. And then decide, with open eyes, whether you want to keep playing.",

    "note_tweet_text": "If you have a markdown plan for a new piece of software that you're getting ready to start implementing with a coding agent such as Claude Code, before starting the actual implementation work, give this a try.\n\nPaste your entire markdown plan into the ChatGPT 5.2 Pro web app with extended reasoning enabled and use this prompt; when it's done, paste the complete output from GPT Pro into Claude Code or Codex and tell it to revise the existing plan file in-place using the feedback:\n\n---\nCarefully review this entire plan for me and come up with your best revisions in terms of better architecture, new features, changed features, etc. to make it better, more robust/reliable, more performant, more compelling/useful, etc.\n\nFor each proposed change, give me your detailed analysis and rationale/justification for why it would make the project better along with the git-diff style changes relative to the original markdown plan shown below:\n\n<PASTE YOUR EXISTING COMPLETE PLAN HERE> \n---\n\nThis has never failed to improve a plan significantly for me. The best part is that you can start a fresh conversation in ChatGPT and do it all again once Claude Code or Codex finishes integrating your last batch of suggested revisions. \n\nAfter four or five rounds of this, you tend to reach a steady-state where the suggestions become very incremental. \n\n(Note: I was originally planning to end this post here, but thought it would be helpful for people to see this part in the larger context of the entire workflow I recommend using all my tooling)\n\nThen you're ready to turn the plan into beads (think of these as epics/tasks/subtasks and associated dependency structure. The name comes from Steve Yegge's amazing project, which is like Jira or Linear, but optimized for use by coding agents), which I do with this prompt using Claude Code with Opus 4.5:\n\n---\nOK so please take ALL of that and elaborate on it more and then create a comprehensive and granular set of beads for all this with tasks, subtasks, and dependency structure overlaid, with detailed comments so that the whole thing is totally self-contained and self-documenting (including relevant background, reasoning/justification, considerations, etc.-- anything we'd want our \"future self\" to know about the goals and intentions and thought process and how it serves the over-arching goals of the project.)  Use only the `bd` tool to create and modify the beads and add the dependencies. Use ultrathink.   \n---\n\nAfter it finished all of that, I then do a round of this prompt (if CC did a compaction at any point, be sure to tell it to re-read your AGENTS dot md file):\n\n---\nCheck over each bead super carefully-- are you sure it makes sense? Is it optimal? Could we change anything to make the system work better for users? If so, revise the beads. It's a lot easier and faster to operate in \"plan space\" before we start implementing these things!  Use ultrathink.   \n---\n\nThen you're ready to start implementing. The fastest way to do that is to start up a big swarm of agents that coordinate using my MCP Agent Mail project. \n\nThen you can simply create a bunch of sessions using Claude Code, Codex, and Gemini-CLI in different windows or panes in tmux (or use my ntm project which tries to abstract and automate some of this) in your project folder at once and give them the following as their marching orders (for this to work well, you need to make sure that your AGENTS dot md file has the right blurbs to explain each of the tools; I'll include a complete example of this in a reply to this post):\n\n---\nFirst read ALL of the AGENTS dot md file and README dot md file super carefully and understand ALL of both! Then use your code investigation agent mode to fully understand the code, and technical architecture and purpose of the project. Then register with MCP Agent Mail and introduce yourself to the other agents. \n\nBe sure to check your agent mail and to promptly respond if needed to any messages; then proceed meticulously with your next assigned beads, working on the tasks systematically and meticulously and tracking your progress via beads and agent mail messages.\n\nDon't get stuck in \"communication purgatory\" where nothing is getting done; be proactive about starting tasks that need to be done, but inform your fellow agents via messages when you do so and mark beads appropriately. \n\nWhen you're not sure what to do next, use the bv tool mentioned in AGENTS dot md to prioritize the best beads to work on next; pick the next one that you can usefully work on and get started. Make sure to acknowledge all communication requests from other agents and that you are aware of all active agents and their names.  Use ultrathink. \n---\n\nIf you've done a good job creating your beads, the agents will be able to get a decent sized chunk of work done in that first pass. Then, before they start moving to the next bead, I have them review all their work with this:\n\n---\nGreat, now I want you to carefully read over all of the new code you just wrote and other existing code you just modified with \"fresh eyes\" looking super carefully for any obvious bugs, errors, problems, issues, confusion, etc. Carefully fix anything you uncover. Use ultrathink. \n---\n\nI keep running rounds of that until they stop finding bugs. Eventually they'll need to do a compaction, so if they do that, right after hit them with this (note that I've been typing AGENTS dot md to avoid the annoying preview on X because it thinks it's a website; you can replace that with a period and remove the spaces if you want; the agents don't care either way):\n\n---\nReread AGENTS dot md so it's still fresh in your mind.   Use ultrathink.     \n---\n\nWhen the reviews come up clean, have them move on to the next bead:\n\n--- \nReread AGENTS dot md so it's still fresh in your mind.   Use ultrathink.   Use bv with the robot flags (see AGENTS dot md for info on this) to find the most impactful bead(s) to work on next and then start on it. Remember to mark the beads appropriately and communicate with your fellow agents. Pick the next bead you can actually do usefully now and start coding on it immediately; communicate what you're working on to your fellow agents and mark beads appropriately as you work. And respond to any agent mail messages you've received. \n---\n\nWhen all your beads are completed, you might want to run one of these prompts:\n\n---\nDo we have full unit test coverage without using mocks/fake stuff? What about complete e2e integration test scripts with great, detailed logging? If not, then create a comprehensive and granular set of beads for all this with tasks, subtasks, and dependency structure overlaid with detailed comments.\n---\n\nor \n\n---\nGreat, now I want you to super carefully scrutinize every aspect of the application workflow and implementation and look for things that just seem sub-optimal or even wrong/mistaken to you, things that could very obviously be improved from a user-friendliness and intuitiveness standpoint, places where our UI/UX could be improved and polished to be slicker, more visually appealing, and more premium feeling and just ultra high quality, like Stripe-level apps.\n---\n\nor \n\n---\nI still think there are strong opportunities to enhance the UI/UX look and feel and to make everything work better and be more intuitive, user-friendly, visually appealing, polished, slick, and world class in terms of following UI/UX best practices like those used by Stripe, don't you agree? And I want you to carefully consider desktop UI/UX and mobile UI/UX separately while doing this and hyper-optimize for both separately to play to the specifics of each modality. I'm looking for true world-class visual appeal, polish, slickness, etc. that makes people gasp at how stunning and perfect it is in every way.  Use ultrathink. \n---\n\nAnd then start the process again of implementing the beads. When you're done with all that and have solid test coverage, you can then keep doing rounds of these two prompts until they consistently come back clean with no changes made:\n\n---\nI want you to sort of randomly explore the code files in this project, choosing code files to deeply investigate and understand and trace their functionality and execution flows through the related code files which they import or which they are imported by.\n\nOnce you understand the purpose of the code in the larger context of the workflows, I want you to do a super careful, methodical, and critical check with \"fresh eyes\" to find any obvious bugs, problems, errors, issues, silly mistakes, etc. and then systematically and meticulously and intelligently correct them. \n\nBe sure to comply with ALL rules in AGENTS dot md and ensure that any code you write or revise conforms to the best practice guides referenced in the AGENTS dot md file. Use ultrathink. \n---\n\nand\n\n---\nOk can you now turn your attention to reviewing the code written by your fellow agents and checking for any issues, bugs, errors, problems, inefficiencies, security problems, reliability issues, etc. and carefully diagnose their underlying root causes using first-principle analysis and then fix or revise them if necessary? Don't restrict yourself to the latest commits, cast a wider net and go super deep! Use ultrathink.\n---\n\nYou should also periodically have one of the agents run this as you're going to commit your work:\n\n---\nNow, based on your knowledge of the project, commit all changed files now in a series of logically connected groupings with super detailed commit messages for each and then push. Take your time to do it right. Don't edit the code at all. Don't commit obviously ephemeral files. Use ultrathink.\n---\n\nIf you simply use these tools, workflows, and prompts in the way I just described, you can create really incredible software in a just a couple days, sometimes in just one day. \n\nI've done it a bunch of times now in the past few weeks and it really does work, as crazy as that may sound. You see my GitHub profile for the proof of this. It looks like the output from a team of 100+ developers. \n\nThe frontier models and coding agent harnesses really are that good already, they just need this extra level of tooling and prompting and workflows to reach their full potential.\n\nTo learn more about my system (which is absolutely free and 100% open-source), check out:\n\nhttps://t.co/22Fy2w73x0\n\nIt include a complete tutorial that shows anyone how to get start with this process. You don't even need to know much at all about computers; you just need the desire to learn and some grit and determination. And about $500/month for the Claude Max and GPT Pro subscriptions, plus another $50 or so for the cloud server.\n\nIf you want to change the entire direction of your life, it has truly never been easier. If you think you might want to do it, I really recommend just immersing yourself. \n\nOnce you get Claude Code up and running on the cloud server, you basically have an ultra competent friend who can help you with any other problems you encounter. \n\nAnd I will personally answer your questions or problems if you reach out to me on X or on GitHub issues (it might be Claude impersonating me though, lol).",
