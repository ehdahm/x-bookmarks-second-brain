I spend my day bouncing between multiple Claude Code / Codex sessions and sometimes too many meetings. I've got three kids, two businesses, one wife, and virtually zero time to build systems that make my life better. \n\nThe data is all there, I just need to bring it together and make sense of it.\n\nThis week, I stumbled upon this awesome agent workflow writeup by @steipete where he mentions what he's building at https://t.co/7QDWnQGfpM , and I was intrigued.\n\nThis is a very appealing AI assistant. Seems like exactly what I'm looking for. So I asked Claude Code to set up Clawdis on a headless Mac Mini on my LAN.\n\nAfter I pointed it to some credentials, my Clawdis (\"Crawdad\" \ud83e\udd9e)  quite literally did the rest, setting itself up, all via WhatsApp. I gave it access to my 5 email accounts, calendars, iMessages (via BlueBubbles server), and Granola transcripts.\n\nThis stuff rarely works the first time. It was awesome.\n\nThen, earlier today, we had a real Jarvis moment.\n\nI was in my car waiting on my wife to emerge from the store, so I sent Crawdad a voice message. I hadn't configured OpenAI API keys for transcribing my voice, so I asked it to try to install and use whisper.cpp (via WhatsApp), and it *just worked*, and will use this method going forward.\n\nExcited to build out more tooling here. I think this is a super important project to watch - seems like it could be the foundation of a unicorn tbh.\n\nThanks for all of your work here Peter - feels like a weight has been lifted for real! 2026 is gonna be lit \ud83d\udd25",

Hearing Meta engineers are forced to use Llama 4. Opus 4.5 is the baseline now. \n\n- give your agents tools to ALL dev tooling: Linear, GitHub, Datadog, Sentry, any Internal tooling. If agents are being held back because of lack of context that\u2019s your fault. \n\n- invest in your codebase specific agent docs. stop saying \u201cdoesn\u2019t do X well\u201d. If that\u2019s an issue, try better prompting, https://t.co/SOjpn47yxo, linting, and code rules. Tell it how you want things. Every manual edit you make is an opportunity for https://t.co/S1ZvtYQwta improvement\n\n- invest in robust background agent infra - get a full development stack working on VM/sandboxes. yes it\u2019s hard to set up but it will be worth it, your engineers can run multiple in parallel. Code review will be the bottleneck soon. \n\n- figure out security issues. stop being risk averse and do what is needed to unblock access to tools. \n\nin your product:\n\n- always use the latest generation models in your features (move things off of last gen models asap, unless robust evals indicate otherwise). Requires changes every 1-2 weeks - eg: GitHub copilot mobile still offers code review with gpt 4.1 and Sonnet 3.5 @jaredpalmer. You are leaving money on the table by being on Sonnet 4, or gpt 4o\n\n- Use embedding semantic search instead of fuzzy search. Any general embedding model will do better than Levenshtein / fuzzy heuristics. \n\n- leave no form unfilled. use structured outputs and whatever context you have on the user to do a best-effort pre-fill\n\n- allow unstructured inputs on all product surfaces - must accept freeform text and documents. Forms are dead.\n\n- custom finetuning is dead. Stop wasting time on it. Frontier is moving too fast to invest 8 weeks into finetuning. Costs are dropping too quickly for price to matter. Better prompting will take you very far and this will only become more true as instruction following improves\n\n- build evals to make quick model-upgrade decisions. they don\u2019t need to be perfect but at least need to allow you to compare models relative to each other. most decisions become clear on a Pareto cost vs benchmark perf plot\n\n- encourage all engineers to build with ai: build primitives to call models from all code bases / models: structured output, semantic similarity endpoints, sandbox code execution. etc\n\nWhat else am I missing?",

And if you are already writing raw queries to work around ORM limitations, you are actually better off using prepared statements directly.\n\nThe ORM abstraction hides query complexity, yes, but it does make it easy to ship inefficient N+1 queries without realizing it. Debugging becomes painful at the worst possible time - during production incidents.\n\nORMs tend to lag behind database features. Indexing strategies, query hints, and newer capabilities are either inconvenient to use (just look at prefetch in Django ORM) or simply unavailable. This makes you opt for the lowest common capability (as offered by ORM) instead of leveraging the database properly.\n\nAt scale, explicit queries are always simpler, faster, and easier to optimize; the cognitive overhead of mapping objects to tables is often not worth it.\n\nTo be fair, ORMs make sense for prototypes and for getting to market quickly. Use them when you are starting out or in the early phases, but have a plan to migrate away from them :)\n\nEasier said than done, though; been there!",

    "note_tweet_text": "Agency > Intelligence\n\nI had this intuitively wrong for decades, I think due to a pervasive cultural veneration of intelligence, various entertainment/media, obsession with IQ etc. Agency is significantly more powerful and significantly more scarce. Are you hiring for agency? Are we educating for agency? Are you acting as if you had 10X agency?\n\nGrok explanation is ~close:\n\n\u201cAgency, as a personality trait, refers to an individual's capacity to take initiative, make decisions, and exert control over their actions and environment. It\u2019s about being proactive rather than reactive\u2014someone with high agency doesn\u2019t just let life happen to them; they shape it. Think of it as a blend of self-efficacy, determination, and a sense of ownership over one\u2019s path.\n\nPeople with strong agency tend to set goals and pursue them with confidence, even in the face of obstacles. They\u2019re the type to say, \u201cI\u2019ll figure it out,\u201d and then actually do it. On the flip side, someone low in agency might feel more like a passenger in their own life, waiting for external forces\u2014like luck, other people, or circumstances\u2014to dictate what happens next.\n\nIt\u2019s not quite the same as assertiveness or ambition, though it can overlap. Agency is quieter, more internal\u2014it\u2019s the belief that you *can* act, paired with the will to follow through. Psychologists often tie it to concepts like locus of control: high-agency folks lean toward an internal locus, feeling they steer their fate, while low-agency folks might lean external, seeing life as something that happens *to* them.\u201d",

You stop randomly collecting tools and start climbing deliberately. You pick a root (say backend engineering), then make sure each lower layer is solid before moving up: \n\nlanguage internals \u2192 concurrency \u2192 I/O \u2192 databases \u2192 distributed coordination \u2192 system design.\n\nEach layer unlocks the next. Skipping layers always comes back to hurt you.\n\nThe key is to practice on concrete problems. Don\u2019t \u201cstudy microservices\u201d in the abstract. Build something small that breaks. Debug a production issue. Design a system that fails under load and fix it.

You\u2019re no longer just learning skills but you\u2019re learning how to learn skills.\n\nAnd in software engineering, that might be the most valuable ability you can have.",

    "note_tweet_text": "The entire robotics industry is about to compress a decade of progress into 18 months, and nobody\u2019s pricing it in.\n\nThe hardware has been ready for years. Boston Dynamics had Atlas doing backflips in 2018. The bottleneck was never motors or actuators. It was that every robot behavior had to be hand-coded. Pick up a box? That\u2019s one program. Pick up a bottle? Different program. Move the box from shelf A to shelf B in a warehouse with slightly different lighting? Start over.\n\nFoundation models broke this completely.\n\nBefore VLAs, teaching a robot one skill gave you exactly one skill. Zero compounding. Zero transfer. A robot trained to fold shirts couldn\u2019t fold towels without starting from scratch. The labor intensity of data generation meant robotics datasets stayed narrow, robots overfit, and small variations like object weight or table height caused failures.\n\nNow a single Gemini Robotics model handles tasks it has never seen in training. Google\u2019s On-Device model learns new behaviors with 50-100 demonstrations. Not 50,000. Fifty. That\u2019s a 1000x reduction in the data requirement for new capabilities.\n\nThe speed implications cascade through everything.\n\nFirst order: deployment timelines collapse. What took robotics teams 6-12 months of custom programming now takes days of fine-tuning. Second order: the addressable market explodes. Tasks that were never economical to automate suddenly are, because the integration cost dropped by orders of magnitude. Third order: the data flywheel accelerates. Every robot running Gemini Robotics feeds learning back into the foundation model. More deployments means faster improvement means more deployments.\n\nPhysical Intelligence raised at $2.4B because investors finally understood this. Boston Dynamics partnered with Toyota Research Institute to bolt Large Behavior Models onto Atlas. Every humanoid company is scrambling to either build or license the intelligence layer they don\u2019t have.\n\nThe market is still valuing robotics companies on their hardware differentiation. But hardware is commoditizing. Boston Dynamics spent a decade perfecting locomotion, and now that\u2019s table stakes. The value is migrating entirely to whoever owns the foundation model that generalizes across embodiments.\n\nGoogle trained Gemini on the largest multimodal corpus ever assembled. Then they added physical actions as an output modality. That\u2019s not a robotics company bolting on AI. That\u2019s an AI company whose models now output motor commands.\n\nThe companies pricing this correctly are building around foundation model access, not around proprietary hardware. The companies pricing this wrong are still acting like the moat is in the mechanical engineering.\n\nAGI moving into the physical world isn\u2019t a 10-year prediction. Gemini Robotics shipped in March. The 1.5 version with chain-of-thought reasoning shipped in September. They\u2019re iterating on a 6-month release cycle while hardware companies iterate on 3-year cycles.\n\nThe gap between software intelligence timelines and hardware development timelines is the entire trade.",
