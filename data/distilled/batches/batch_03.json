When things go right, when things go wrong, when I\u2019m not even sure which way they\u2019ve gone, I\u2019ll ask myself \u201cAgain?\u201d The answer is obvious.\n\nWhat\u2019s great about this is that things that would objectively measure as \u201cwrong\u201d can be absolutely worth it when you ask the question \u201cAgain?\u201d With again, you aren\u2019t just measuring outcome, you\u2019re also measuring experience. Experience contains outcome, and a whole lot more.\n\nMaybe that was a flop commercially, but it was worth it broadly, so yes, I\u2019d still do it all over again. Or, wow, that was a smashing success but it really beat me down... Would I do it again? \u201cNo\u201d is perfectly valid, and correct, in that case.\n\nAsking \u201cAgain?\u201d is one of the simplest things you can do, and it\u2019ll mine some of the richest answers you\u2019ll find.

Angles drift. Details soften. The model starts inventing what it thinks you want because its attention is split across 9, 12, or 16 frames at once.\n\nPersonally, I use 1x4 vertical grids and export each frame to 16:9 afterward.\n\nTwo reasons:\n1/ It preserves detail and consistency shot after shot.\nInstead of playing roulette by asking for random angles, it forces you to be intentional. \n2/You describe the shot you need, the background you expect, and the framing that serves your story. Nano Banana Pro still struggles with environment rotation unless you guide it very explicitly.\n\nYou do you. But I have watched the 3x3 approach go viral a week after this method was shared, get adopted by everyone, and now I am seeing many of those same people quietly move away from it because it does not deliver on consistency.\n\nTrends move fast.
