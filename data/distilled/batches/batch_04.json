    "note_tweet_text": "What happens to the App Store when vibe coding makes building apps 100\u00d7 faster and cheaper?\n\nA few things I think start to happen:\n\n1. Apps increasingly launch for very specific moments instead of trying to keep users forever. You download it, get value, and move on.\n\n2. Apps that solve a problem in under 30 seconds convert 2\u20133\u00d7 better than apps that require onboarding.\n\n3. A new pricing norm emerges: ~$1\u2013$10 for one moment of value, paid instantly, with no expectation of future use. Disposable apps.\n\n4. More examples of revenue concentrating at the account level, not the app level. You'll see seven/eight/even 9  igures across dozens of micro-apps.\n\n5. Some of the most valuable apps never appear in App Store rankings because they spread peer-to-peer and are super niche. \n\n6. Founders start shipping 10-20 micro-apps per year, expecting 1\u20132 to stick, instead of betting everything on one product.\n\n7. The average successful app team trends toward 1\u20132 people, even at $1\u20135M ARR, because product surfaces stay small.\n\n8. Distribution shifts toward people with trust. Creators, communities, and group chats quietly become the real app curators.\n\n9. More extremely niche apps that didn't make sense to build are now being launched \n\n10. Apps get named like content, not companies. Short, emotional, contextual names win.\n\n11. App naming converges toward 5\u20138 character names because they perform better in links, sharing, and memory.\n\n12. Apps win on tone and identity more than features. Two apps can do the same thing, but one feels like it\u2019s \u201cfor you.\u201d\n\n13. The fastest growing category becomes \u201cutility + identity\u201d apps, tools that also signal taste or values.\n\n14. Personalization becomes default. The same underlying app shows up in different versions depending on who you are and why you\u2019re using it.\n\n15. Launches start to look like content drops. Timing, story, and where an app shows up matter more than the tech itself.\n\n16. Successful apps group into small bundles that match a lifestyle, job, or niche instead of standing alone.\n\n17. Apple leans harder into bundles and curated experiences, acting more like a trusted editor than a giant directory.\n\n18. Apple quietly favors apps that fit healthy usage patterns because it aligns with device trust.\n\n19. Mobile vibe coding pushes creation onto the phone itself. People build apps while waiting, walking, or thinking, not sitting at a desk. Realistically not everyone will want to create apps, but 100x+ more do.\n\n20. App fatigue increases, but software usefulness improves. People delete more apps and feel better about the ones they keep.\n\n21. Over time, people stop saying \u201cI use this app\u201d and start saying \u201cI made a small app for that.\u201d",

Messaging & Streaming\nAt-least-once vs exactly-once, backpressure, consumer lag, replay.\nData in motion is harder than data at rest.\n\n8. Load, Backpressure & Flow Control\nRate limiting, queues, bounded buffers, admission control.\nGood systems degrade gracefully instead of falling over.\n\n9.

Security as a Distributed Problem\nIdentity, auth, key rotation, zero trust, blast-radius reduction.\nSecurity failures scale just as fast as data does.\n\n11. Operational Simplicity\nBoring architectures, predictable failure modes, easy rollback.\nSystems survive decades because humans can operate them.\n\n12. Resource Economics\nLatency vs throughput, memory vs CPU, network vs compute.\nEvery design decision is a cost trade-off, whether you admit it or not.\n\nThese aren\u2019t trends.\nThey are physical laws of computation at scale.\n\nLanguages change. Clouds change.

The design doc starts off as a proposal doc. If you can get enough stakeholders to agree that your proposal has merit, you move on to developing out the system design itself. This includes the full architecture, integrations with other teams, etc.\n\nDesign review before launching into the development effort. This is where you have your teams design doc absolutely shredded by Senior Engineers. This is good. I think of it as front loading the pain.\n\nIf you pass review, you can now launch into the development effort. The first few weeks are spent doing more documentation on each subsystem that will be built by the individual dev teams.\n\nBacklog development and sprint planning. This is where the devs work with the PMs and TPMs to hammer out discrete tasks that individual devs will work on and the order.\n\nSoftware development. Finally, we can now get hands on keyboard and start crushing task tickets. This is where AI has been a force multiplier. We use Test Driven Development, so I have the AI coding agent write the tests first for the feature I\u2019m going to build. Only then do I start using the agent to build out the feature.\n\nCode submission review. We have a two dev approval process before code can get merged into man. AI is also showing great promise in assisting with the review.\n\nTest in staging. If staging is good to go, we push to prod.\"\n\n---\n\nreddit. com/r/vibecoding/comments/1myakhd/how_we_vibe_code_at_a_faang/",

Sell on Webflow, Framer, UI8 for $50-100 each. Stack enough and you're clearing six figures.\n\n4. Taste is the new moat. AI raises the baseline. Your visual judgment becomes the differentiator, not your Figma speed.\n\n5. Avoid AI slop. Purple gradients, Lucid icons, generic layouts. Switch to Iconify Solar for variety\u2014it has outline, broken, duotone styles.\n\n6. Use Simple Icons via Iconify for logos. Apple, Google, whatever. One API reference in your prompt, no more hunting SVGs.\n\n7. Work section by section. Hero first in Aura/v0/Cursor, then features, then footer. Faster iterations, better creative control.\n\n8. Remix everything. Grab screenshots from Mobbin (sites \u2192 sections) or Bento Grids. Change colors, text, animations. Mold it new.\n\n9. Use negative prompts. \"Don't change anything else\" or \"keep the hero\" prevents AI from breaking what already works.\n\n10. Fix images manually. AI breaks them constantly. Use Midjourney or Nano Banana Pro to generate replacements and mockups.\n\n11. Typography matters. Google Fonts are free and AI-friendly. Inter is overused\u2014try Newsreader or Playfair Display for differentiation.\n\n12. Add craft signals. 01/02/03 numbering, beam animations, noodles, container-sized grid lines. Use Unicorn Studio for hero backgrounds.\n\n13. Steal headlines from H1 Gallery. Better hooks = better conversions. https://t.co/lsdT6ffsXA for call-to-action inspiration.\n\n14. Present work properly. Use Screen Studio for recordings. Screenshot with polished backgrounds\u2014this is what drives social engagement.\n\n15. Speed trick: Use GPT-5.1 for small text/color changes. Save Gemini 3 for complex UI generation.\n\nBottom line: Superhero for heroes, Mobbin for sections, Bento Grids for cards, Iconify for icons. Screenshot \u2192 Gemini 3 \u2192 Remix \u2192 Polish.

If you force it via the use of \"you\", it will give you something by adopting a personality embedding vector implied by the statistics of its finetuning data and then simulate that. It's fine to do, but there is a lot less mystique to it than I find people naively attribute to \"asking an AI\".",
