    "note_tweet_text": "ChatGPT just announced that you can integrate your products with its platform.\n\nNow you can get your products indexed, ranked, and displayed inside ChatGPT with live prices and availability.\n\nHere is a full recap of how to do it all by yourself. No need to hire any expensive outside help.\n\nBefore we get into it, though...\n\nIf you want some free cheat codes for getting traffic and sales from ChatGPT and Perplexity, just RT this, follow me, and reply \"SEO Stuff Cheat Codes\" and I will DM you.\n\nYou must do all 3 for the DM.\n\nAnd if you want traffic + sales from ChatGPT and Google on autopilot so that you can focus on your core business let SEO Stuff (https://t.co/wKpf0EILTx) do all the heavy lifting. \n\nThe Gold Plan (https://t.co/MMsDTFf4rg) is so popular that more than 80 percent of customers who buy it return for multiple other purchases.\n\nAlright, let\u2019s get into it.\n\nOpenAI recently announced that users will be able to buy directly from Shopify and Etsy sellers.\n\nThey also announced that they were open-sourcing the technology that powers Instant Checkout, the Agentic Commerce Protocol, so that more merchants and developers can begin building their integrations.\n\nEveryone called this a \u201cShopify moment\u201d for AI, but it is actually deeper than that.\n\nUploading a feed is not enough.\n\nIf your site structure, authority, and content are not already optimized for AI discovery, ChatGPT will not surface your products.\n\nOpenAI\u2019s Product Feed Spec is a set of rules for sharing structured product data with ChatGPT.\n\nThink of it like a Merchant Center feed for AI search.\n\nWhen you give ChatGPT your product data in a structured format, it can show your listings with accurate titles, prices, stock, and images directly inside chat.\n\nHere is the process:\n\nPrepare your feed in CSV, TSV, XML, or JSON format.\n\nInclude required fields like product ID, title, description, price, and availability.\n\nDeliver it to OpenAI\u2019s endpoint.\n\nKeep it updated every time products or prices change.\n\nBut the feed only works if your site\u2019s content and schema are clean.\n\nThe key feed sections:\n\n1. OpenAI Flags\n\nTwo simple settings control visibility:\n\nenable_search: lets ChatGPT show your product in search results.\n\nenable_checkout: lets users buy directly inside ChatGPT.\n\nYou must set enable_search to true before enable_checkout can work.\n\nIf your store\u2019s content is not being indexed or trusted by ChatGPT yet, enabling checkout will not matter.\n\n2. Basic Product Data\n\nThis is the foundation. Every product needs:\n\nid: your product\u2019s unique SKU.\n\ntitle: your product name (clear, natural, no all-caps).\n\ndescription: plain text up to 5,000 characters.\n\nlink: the URL to the product page.\n\nThese fields help ChatGPT connect your feed data to your website.\n\nIf your site titles, descriptions, and canonical URLs are messy, the feed will not parse properly.\n\n3. Item Information\n\nThis tells ChatGPT what your product actually is.\n\nFields include brand, category, and material.\n\nCondition (new, used, refurbished).\n\nWeight, dimensions, and age_group.\n\nThese help AI engines group your product correctly with similar listings.\n\nFor example, if your product category says \u201capparel > shoes,\u201d ChatGPT knows how to classify it for running shoes instead of electronics.\n\nMost e-commerce sites mislabel these categories or use inconsistent formatting.\n\n4. Media\n\nThis is where most brands underperform.\n\nYou need:\n\nimage_link: main image.\n\nadditional_image_link: extra product images.\n\nvideo_link or 3D_model_link (optional but powerful).\n\nChatGPT favors listings with clear, high-resolution images.\n\nFeeds with broken or low-quality image links are often excluded entirely.\n\n5. Price and Promotions\n\nThese fields tell ChatGPT how to display pricing and discounts:\n\nprice: base price with currency code (for example, 79.99 USD).\n\nsale_price: optional, must be lower than base price.\n\nsale_price_effective_date: when the discount is valid.\n\nThe feed updates every 15 minutes.\n\n6. Availability and Inventory\n\nYou must declare:\n\navailability: in_stock, out_of_stock, or preorder.\n\ninventory_quantity: how many units are left.\n\navailability_date: if the product is on preorder.\n\nFeeds that show \u201cin stock\u201d but link to out-of-stock pages lose trust and visibility quickly.\n\nThis is where freshness and structured data updates matter most.\n\n7. Variants and Groupings\n\nProducts with sizes, colors, or styles must use item_group_id to connect all versions of a product.\n\nExample: one \u201cMen\u2019s Running Shoe\u201d might have ten variants in color and size.\n\nWithout proper grouping, ChatGPT treats them as unrelated products, breaking discoverability.\n\n8. Reviews and Q&A\n\nOpenAI values review data.\n\nIncluding these fields improves ranking and user trust:\n\nproduct_review_count\n\nproduct_review_rating\n\nstore_review_count\n\nstore_review_rating\n\nq_and_a\n\nMost stores never implement review schema or connect their data.\n\n9. Merchant and Returns Info\n\nOpenAI requires:\n\nseller_name and seller_url.\n\nPrivacy policy and Terms of Service links if you enable checkout.\n\nReturn policy URL and return_window (in days).\n\nThese details are critical for being included in ChatGPT\u2019s shopping module.\n\nMissing policies mean your listings will not be purchasable in chat.\n\nSo why does all this matter?\n\nThe Product Feed Spec gives you the syntax to get indexed in ChatGPT, but syntax alone does not earn visibility within AI platforms.\n\nChatGPT prioritizes structured, authoritative, and trusted sources.\n\nIf your content, links, and schema are weak, your feed will not rank even if it is formatted correctly.\n\nThat is where SEO Stuff (https://t.co/wKpf0EILTx) comes in.\n\nGold Plan: snippet-ready content and backlink authority to rank in Google and AI systems.\n\nhttps://t.co/yEFyM0Ze7W\n\nPremium Content Bundle: sixty optimized articles, product descriptions, and comparison pages built for AI extraction and schema compliance.\n\nhttps://t.co/4CAnUt07PO\n\nPremium Backlink Bundle: three DR50+ backlinks from high-trust, AI-visible sites.\n\nhttps://t.co/Z9m9D7TjES\n\nTogether, they create the visibility foundation your business depends on.\n\nOpenAI\u2019s Product Feed Spec makes ChatGPT commerce possible.\n\nBut before your feed matters, your site has to be discoverable, structured, and trusted.\n\nThat is what SEO Stuff (https://t.co/wKpf0EILTx) customers already have in place.\n\nAnd if you want some free cheat codes for getting traffic and sales from ChatGPT and Perplexity, just RT this, follow me, and reply \"SEO Stuff Cheat Codes\" and I will DM you.\n\nYou must do all 3 for the DM.",

    "note_tweet_text": "# Enough AI copilots! We need AI HUDs\n\nIMO, one of the best critiques of modern AI design comes from a 1992 talk by the researcher Mark Weiser, where he ranted against \"copilot\" as a metaphor for AI. \n\n33 years ago, but still incredibly relevant for anyone designing with AI...\n\nWeiser was speaking at an MIT Media Lab event on \"interface agents\". They were grappling with many of the same issues we're discussing in 2025: how to make a personal assistant that automates tasks for you and knows your full context. They even had a human \"butler\" on stage representing an AI agent.\n\nEveryone was super excited about this... except Weiser. He was opposed to the whole idea of agents!\n\nHe gave this example: how should a computer help you fly a plane and avoid collisions?\n\nThe agentic option is a \"copilot\" \u2014 a virtual human who you talk with to get help flying the plane. If you're about to run into another plane it might yell at you \"collision, go right and down!\"\n\nWeiser offered a different option: design the cockpit so that the human pilot is naturally aware of their surroundings. In his words: \"You\u2019ll no more run into another airplane than you would try to walk through a wall.\" \n\nWeiser's goal was an \"invisible computer\"\u2014not an assistant that grabs your attention, but a computer that fades into the background and becomes \"an extension of [your] body\".\n\nThere's a tool in modern planes that I think nicely illustrates Weiser's philosophy: the Head-Up Display (HUD), which overlays flight info like the horizon and altitude on a transparent display directly in the pilot's field of view. \n\nA HUD feels completely different from a copilot! You don't talk to it. It's literally part invisible\u2014you just become naturally aware of more things, as if you had magic eyes.\n\n## designing HUDs\n\nOK enough analogies. What might a HUD feel like in modern software design?\n\nOne familiar example is spellcheck. Think about it: spellcheck isn't designed as a \"virtual collaborator\" talking to you about your spelling. It just instantly adds red squigglies when you misspell something! You now have a new sense you didn't have before. It's a HUD.\n\n(This example comes from Jeff Heer's excellent Agency plus Automation paper. We may not consider spellcheck an AI feature today, but it's still a fuzzy algorithm under the hood.)\n\nHere's another personal example from AI coding. Let's say you wanna fix a bug. The obvious \"copilot\" way is to open an agent chat and ask it to do the fix.\n\nBut there's another approach I've found more powerful at times: use AI to build a *custom debugger UI* which visualizes the behavior of my program. (https://t.co/bzyaI4q5jM)\n\nWith the debug view, I have a HUD! I have new senses, I can see how my program runs. The HUD extends beyond the narrow task of fixing the bug. I can ambiently build up my own understanding, spotting new problems and opportunities.\n\nBoth the spellchecker and custom debuggers show that automation / \"virtual assistant\" isn't the only possible UI. We can instead use tech to build better HUDs that enhance our human senses.\n\n## tradeoffs\n\nI don't believe HUDs are universally better than copilots! But I do believe anyone serious about designing for AI should consider non-copilot form factors that more directly extend the human mind.\n\nHmm so when should we use one or the other? TBH I think it's super tricky, but we can try to use the airplane analogy for some intuition:\n\nWhen pilots just want the plane to fly straight and level, they delegate that task to a \"virtual copilot\" autopilot system. But if the plane just hit a flock of birds and needs to land in the Hudson, the pilot is gonna take manual control, and we better hope they have great instruments that help them understand the situation.\n\nIn other words: routine predictable work might make sense to delegate to a virtual copilot / assistant. But when you're shooting for extraordinary outcomes, perhaps the best bet is to equip human experts with new superpowers...",

The goal can be anything - asking clarifying questions, getting feedback, collecting user data. \n\nBetween this and using tool call to manage a working TodoList, i feel like we have just started scratching the surface of how versatile this tool calling framework is.",

Grab your instance\u2019s public IP, open it in your browser, and you\u2019ll see your app running on the cloud.\n\n5. Start scaling ? create another EC2 instance and set up an Application Load Balancer to route traffic.\n\n6. Tired of adding instances manually? Use Auto Scaling Groups (ASG)  define min/max instances, attach a launch template/AMI of your app, and AWS will scale automatically based on CPU or request load.\n\n7. Getting millions of requests and your DB is choking? Use Kafka or SQS for buffering high-throughput workloads. Learn more about async\n\n8. Store images, videos, or backups? Use S3 connect it from your app via the SDK, and make a file uploader.\n\n9. Use RDS for managed databases (MySQL/Postgres). AWS handles backups, scaling, and maintenance.\n\n10 Use CloudWatch to monitor your instances, logs, and metrics. Set up alerts when CPU spikes or memory usage is high.\n\n11. For networking, explore VPCs  subnets, route tables, gateways. This is where you learn how AWS isolates traffic securely. You will learn really well about networking here. Just create a vpc and play around\n\n12. Once you\u2019re comfortable, try Terraform to automate infra because that's 100X easier to manage state.\n\nStage 13: Say Fuck AWS for stealing money and buy your own VPS, set up Docker, or use Coolify for one-click PaaS setups.",

We\u2019re entering clown world with the amount of AI building we\u2019re seeing. \ud83e\udd21\ud83c\udf0e\n\nAll I see in the data infra space is companies building infrastructure for AI Agents with the obligatory buzzwords like A2A or MCP.\n\nWho is productionizing these AI Agents?\n\nTwo years of marketing hype in, I have literally only seen ONE talk about an AI \"Agent\" in prod. It's by Uber and it's used for code generation. First off - it's a dev tool and second - it's not even an agent, it's a workflow.\n\nWho honestly thinks the future of software architecture will be hundreds of AI Agents talking to each other, similar to microservices today?\n\nDoes anyone ACTUALLY believe this is what the world will be in 5 years?\n\nCan they comment here and share their perspective?\n\nThe data is pointing to the opposite.\n\n\u2022 We haven't seen any major LLM advancements since GPT-4.\n\u2022 All frontier model companies are grossly unprofitable with no sustainable path.\n\u2022 A lot of investments between big tech are circular (recycling revenue)\n\nEven in a winner-take-all model, OpenAI is burning $5 BILLION a year.\n\nAnthropic, the number two, is looking way, way worse regarding its revenue model.\n\nWhat happens when the funding stops?\n\nCompanies chasing investor interest via shiny narratives are missing the forest for the trees - we, the engineers, need practical solutions.\n\nThat's what's going to last.\n\nFortunately, I see two trends growing quietly behind the spotlight (the sloplight?) of AI.\n\nThey will most certainly survive a dot-com like crash if that were to happen.\n\nThey are:\n\u2022 Small Data\n\u2022 The \u201cJust Use Postgres\u201d Renaissance\n\nThe common theme between both?\n\nSimplification.\n\n\u2666\ufe0f Small data is the cure for the Big Data hangover that tech collectively went through in the 2010s. It\u2019s the group realization that:\n\n\u2022 organizations don\u2019t use that much data\n\u2022 hardware is getting really, really good\n\nMost applications will never see a terabyte of data, even if they\u2019re successful.\n\nSnowflake and Redshift-published data showed that 99.9% of real-world queries fit on one node. \ud83d\udca1\n\nAnd the nodes are becoming super beefy. AMD released a 192-core (!) CPU this summer. 2025-era SSDs can do 5.5 million random reads a second and 28 GiB/s sequential reads.\n\nEmbedded and simple systems like DuckDB are going viral for a reason.\n\n\u2666\ufe0f Postgres is doing to data infrastructure what the monolith comeback is doing to the microservices architecture.\n\nIt\u2019s the group realization that Postgres can handle 80% of companies' needs. And it does it with 20% the effort.\n\nIt\u2019s not the extreme view where \"when you have a hammer, everything looks like a nail\".\n\n\ud83d\udc49 It\u2019s the extremely reasonable and practical application of reducing the amount of system sprawl in your organization when that sprawl isn\u2019t warranted.\n\nInstead of MongoDB, Redis, an AI Vector database, Snowflake and Elasticsearch - you can use tsvector, pg_mooncake, pgvector, unlogged tables and jsonb in Postgres.\n\nLife becomes significantly simpler when you don't have to manage 5 different systems. There is a ton of organizational overhead in having to:\n\u2022 learn their nuances/configs/gotchas,\n\u2022 learn their UIs and terminology\n\u2022 learn how to deploy and upgrade them safely\n\u2022 build operational expertise\n\u2022 write runbooks for them\n\u2022 debug them\n\u2022 test them\n\u2022 find, hire and retain talent that understand them\n\u2022 keep up with their ecosystems\n\u2022 etc.\n\nPaying this organizational overhead for zero significant gain is not worth it.\n\nIt's all common sense.",

    "note_tweet_text": "I finally got around to making a tool I've wanted for a long time: you can basically think of it as being \"like Gmail for coding agents.\"\n\nIf you've ever tried to use a bunch of instances of Claude Code or Codex at once across the same project, you've probably noticed how annoying it can be when they freak out about the other agent changing the files they're working on.\n\nThen they start doing annoying things, like restoring files from git, in the process wiping out another agent's work without a backup.  \n\nOr if you've tried to have agents coordinate on two separate repos, like a Python backend and a Nextjs frontend for the same project, you may have found yourself acting as the go-between and liaison between two or three different agents, passing messages between them or having them communicate by means of markdown files or some other workaround.\n\nI always knew there had to be a better way. But it's hard to get the big providers to offer something like that in a way that's universal, because Anthropic doesn't want to integrate with OpenAI's competitive coding tool, and neither wants to deal with Cursor or Gemini-CLI.  \n\nSo a few days ago, I started working on it, and it's now ready to share with the world. Introducing the 100% open-source MCP Agent Mail tool. This can be set up very quickly and easily on your machine and automatically detects all the most common coding agents and configures everything for you.\n\nI also include a ready-made blurb (see the README file in the repo, link in the next tweet) that you can add to your existing AGENTS dot md or CLAUDE dot md file to help the agents better leverage the system straight out of the gate.  \n\nIt's almost comical how quickly the agents take to this system like a fish to water. They seem to relish in it, sending very detailed messages to each other just like humans do, and start coordinating in a natural, powerful way. They even give each other good ideas and pushback on bad ideas. They can also reserve access to certain files to avoid the \"too many cooks\" problems associated with having too many agents all working on the same project at the same time, all without dealing with git worktrees and \"merge hell.\"\n\nThis also introduces a natural and powerful way to do something I've also long wanted, which is to automatically have multiple different frontier models working together in a collaborative, complementary way without me needing to be in the middle coordinating everything like a parent setting up playdates for their kids. \n\nAnd for the human in the loop, I made a really slick web frontend that you can view and see all the messages your agents are sending each other in a nice, Gmail-like interface, so you can monitor the process. You can even send a special message to some or all your agents as the \"Human Overseer\" to give them a directive (of course, you can also just type that in manually into each coding agent, too.)\n\nI made this for myself and know that I'm going to be getting a ton of usage out of it going forward. It really lets you unleash a massive number of agents using a bunch of different tools/models, and they just naturally coordinate and work with each other without stepping on each other's toes. It lets you as the human overseer relax a bit more as you no longer have to be the one responsible for coordinating things, and also because the agents watch each other and push back when they see mistakes and errors happening. Obviously, the greater the variety of models and agent tools you use, the more valuable that emergent peer review process will be.\n\nAnyway, give it a try and let me know what you think. I'm sure there are a bunch of bugs that I'll have to iron out over the next couple days, but I've already been productively using it today to work on another project and it is pretty amazingly functional already!",

Social agents should be the same.\n\nEvery AI SF company is obsessed with how much context they have on you but completely ignore what context you\u00a0have on them.\n\nOur AI counterparts must already be relevant, already part of the conversation.\n\nNot strangers or tools, rather, residents among us.\n\nDisney's most valuable asset is character IP.\n\nWhy doesn't Simba from The Lion King have an instagram account where he posts, engages in comments and gets added to group chats?\n\nThat's the future of social agents.\n\nAnd yes, to test this (profitably) we built a vc-backed phone farm.\n\nYou should try it :)",

Have it explain system errors in plain English\n5. Let it write emails while you're in Slack\n\nFor Automators:\n1. Install the filesystem extension (Settings \u2192 Extensions)\n2. Set up GitHub MCP server for automatic code reviews\n3. Connect your database - no more SQL query guessing\n4. Use https://t.co/ecIzsWwx9Q in your repos (AI reads your conventions automatically)\n5. Chain tools together: \"research \u2192 summarize \u2192 email \u2192 schedule\"\n\nThe automation space is sweating because anyone can now:\n\u2192 Build workflows that cost $200/month on Make/Zapier\n\u2192 Access 100+ services without learning 100 APIs\n\u2192 Run multi-step automation with one prompt\n\u2192 Keep everything local (no cloud security nightmares)\n\nOne Zapier Power subscription ($588/year) = 2.9 years of Claude Pro with Desktop free.\n\nLet that sink in.\n\nThe people still paying for workflow automation tools don't know this exists yet.",

    "note_tweet_text": "You're a frontend dev. You just built a killer UI.\n\nNow you're stuck.\n\nYou need a backend. You need a database. You need user auth. And that \"weekend project\" just became a 3-month infrastructure nightmare.\n\nYou think, \"I need a server, an RDS instance, I need to write 50 Express routes for CRUD, I need to implement JWTs, bcrypt, password reset...\"\n\nThis is the exact moment 90% of indie projects die.\n\nFor years, the answer was Firebase. But that meant getting locked into a NoSQL world (Firestore) that's not always the right fit.\n\nToday, I really dove into Supabase, and I'm stunned. It\u2019s the open-source alternative built on the one thing we all trust: Postgres.\n\nI was expecting just a database. What I got was a production-ready, scalable backend in minutes.\n\nHere was my journey:\n\nLevel 1: The Database API\nI created my project. Supabase gives you a full, grown-up Postgres database.\nI went to the SQL Editor and created a table: `create table posts (...)`.\n\nThe second I saved it, Supabase instantly and automatically generated a full RESTful API for it.\n\nMy `GET /posts` and `POST /posts` endpoints just... existed. I didn't write a single line of backend code.\n\nLevel 2: The Auth (and the real genius)\nI needed user sign-ups. This is usually the part I hate.\nI clicked the \"Auth\" tab. It just handles it. Google, GitHub, email/password, magic links... it's all there.\n\nBut here is the genius part. It\u2019s not separate from the database. It's built on it using Postgres's Row Level Security (RLS).\n\nI wrote ONE simple SQL policy:\n`create policy \"Users can only see their own posts.\"\non posts for select\nusing ( auth.uid() = author_id );`\n\nAnd that's it. My API was secure. Supabase's API automatically enforces this. No more `if (https://t.co/NAFMfNoARo !== https://t.co/9w1bCxVuKL_id)` logic in my backend. It\u2019s handled at the database layer.\n\nLevel 3: The \"Wait, what?\" Features\n- Storage: \"I need users to upload profile pictures.\" Click \"Storage.\" It's an S3-compatible bucket, already hooked into your RLS policies.\n- Realtime: \"I want to show a 'New Post!' notification.\" Click \"Realtime.\" Now I can subscribe to any change in my database *instantly*. No websockets, no setup.\n\nLevel 4: The \"Pro Escape Hatch\" (What I Used Today)\nThis is what sold me. The auto-generated API is great, but I needed custom logic.\n\nMy Problem: \"When a new user signs up, I need to call the Resend API to send them a welcome email.\"\n\nMy old workflow: Spin up a separate Vercel function, figure out webhooks, manage API keys... it's a mess.\n\nMy new workflow:\n1. I wrote a Supabase Edge Function. It's just a TypeScript file using Deno that lives right in my Supabase project.\n2. The function's code was simple: pull the new user's email from the request and `fetch` the Resend API.\n3. I deployed it.\n4. I told Supabase to trigger this function as a webhook every time a new row is inserted into the `auth.users` table.\n\nThe entire process took 10 minutes.\n\nMy custom backend logic is now serverless, deployed globally, and co-located with my database.\n\nSupabase isn't a \"toy\" BaaS. It's an insane accelerator built on top of pro-grade, open-source tools. It\u2019s the first platform that feels like it\u2019s helping me, not limiting me.\n\nIt's the cheat code to go from frontend to full-stack.",
