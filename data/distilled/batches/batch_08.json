I open up these files and study them\n- I try noticing patterns like typography, what tailwind classnames have been used, how are the sub components structured\n\n> Build a PWA / Mobile UI \n\n- I open up the UI to be in Mobile mode and see if the User Experience is good. If not, I simply put screenshot into  and ask it to make the changes\n- Understand that people any ui from Top left to bottom right and you need to serve good stuff in that journey\n\n> Additional notes\n\n- Smooth hover, button clicks, page transitions, Tiny delights = premium feel\n- Clean fonts + breathing room = instant \u201csexy\u201d, Margins/spacing do more than you think\n- A slow app can never be sexy; Optimise load time, animations, responsiveness\n\nThis has been my Workflow for the past few weeks\n\nGood UI \u2192 Good Experience \u2192 Higher Shareability \n\nMake products that get shared, loved and worshiped by it's users\n\nThat's it !

    "note_tweet_text": "New short course: Vibe Coding 101 with Replit! Learn to build and host applications with an AI agent in this course, built in partnership with @Replit and taught by its President @pirroh and Head of Developer Relations @mattppal.\n\nCoding agents are changing how we write code. \"Vibe coding\" refers to a growing practice where you might barely look at the generated code, and instead focus on the architecture and features of your application. However, contrary to popular belief, effectively coding this way isn't done by just prompting, accepting all recommendations, and hoping for the best. It requires structuring your work, refining your prompts, and having a systematic process that lead to a more efficient and effective workflow.\n\nI code frequently using LLMs, and asking an LLM to do everything in one shot usually does not work. I'll typically take a problem, partition it into manageable modules, spend time creating prompts to specify each module, and use the model to produce the code one module at a time, and test/debug each module before moving on. A process like this is making me and many other developers faster and more efficient.\n\nIn this video-only course, you\u2019ll learn how to use Replit\u2019s cloud environment--with an integrated code editor, package manager, and deployment tools--to build and deploy web applications. Along the way, you\u2019ll learn strategies for working effectively with agents and improve your development skills.\n\nIn detail, you\u2019ll:\n- Understand principles of agentic code development such as being precise, giving agents one task at a time, making prompts specific, keeping projects tidy, starting with fresh sessions for each new feature, and how to approach debugging.\n- Learn how to get started with Replit, and key skills for vibe coding: Thinking, using frameworks, checkpoints, debugging, and providing context.\n- Create a product requirement document (PRD) and wireframe for your agent to build a prototype of a website performance analyzer.\n- See how to use an agent to make your prototype more visually appealing, and deploy it application others to access .\n- Learn to build a head-to-head national park ranking app, from a sample dataset, with voting capabilities and persistent data storage, and refine further ask the assistant to recap and explain what it built to find room for improvement and reinforce your learning.\n\nBy the end of this course, you\u2019ll have a solid foundation in building with coding agents, and a process you can use to keep vibe coding effectively.\n\nPlease sign up here: https://t.co/yDbX1QFTI7",

Creative Exploration - Possibility Spaces \n11. Content Strategy and Keyword Research\n12. AI-Generated Content\n13. Fashion recommendation project\n14. Home Automation Project \n\nTLDR: As you can see below the major use case is as a learning tool and specifically with voice mode.\n\nBrendan Foody, @BrendanFoody (CEO, Mercor) \nChatGPT Voice Mode as a Thought Partner \n\"I also talk to it to get advice on problems. I find it helpful to just reason through almost as a thought partner. I find I think better sometimes when I'm talking something through, but I can't talk through everything with colleagues or people around me. I like ChatGPT voice mode a lot.\"\n\nRobbie Stein, @rmstein (VP of Product for Google Search) \nVoice Mode for Continuous Learning \n\"I think one of the coolest trends ever is how AI is affecting multimodal voice and, you know, theres this concept called live which is visual and inspirational needs for people... You can just turn on voice mode and talk to it on my way into work.\" \n\nFamily Education \nI hear all my kids come home, like, can I talk to Google about something? Like, what do you need? What do you need to say? And then they go to my app, they hit the live button and they just start talking to it. They wanna know about animals, they wanna know about, you know, certain history things. They learn about something in school, and its so natural to learn in that way, that I think that thats helping them become much more AI native than any other thing Im doing.\" \n\nJason Droege, @jdroege (CEO of Scale AI)\nLearning and Professional Development \n\"I use it as a tutor. You know, as these new concepts come up, you know, I have a lot of people in the company who can educate me on the nuances of the technicals... But they only have so much time. And honestly, theres new concepts coming up all the time and I need to stay on top of it. \n\nDocument Analysis\n\"I think number two would be I'll take the internal documents, and I'll ask whats the most important thing in this document. And Im shocked. And then Ill read it and just double check. But Im shocked at how good it is at just pulling out. Theres so much in organizations that is like, I dont know what you want me to say, and I dont know what I need to know. There's like this huge broadcast problem, where its like, of all of the information you might want to receive, like how whats actually important to you. And so I use it a lot for that too.\" \n\nJulie Zhuo, @joulee (Former Head of Design at Meta; Founder, Sundial)\nUsing ChatGPT for Customized Learning\n\"Sometimes what I'll do is Ill find a curriculum online. If you take a course, it'll be like this twelve-week curriculum, and I will just feed it into ChatGPT. And I'll say, help me customize a program for me using the ways that I like to learn. Like, I am a person who really needs examples. I need a lot of, explain like Im five, give me an analogy.\" \n\n\"Traditionally, we would say, well, I have to learn that from a human. I have to ask this person, and now I'm gonna take a bunch of their time because I want them to explain everything to me. And in fact, I think these days ChatGPT or these other AI tools are better teachers.\" \n\nAlbert Cheng (Growth Leader at https://t.co/TjHMAGDtgW, Grammarly, Duolingo)\nText-to-SQL Slack Bot for Data Democratization\n\"I think one of the the latest things that weve been tinkering around with is this text to SQL capability. Its actually pretty powerful. We have this data request Slack channel where for the longest time and this is still true today. Like, people will toss in all sorts of just one off questions, you know, how many subscribers do we have in South Africa? Or, like, you know, how long did somebody play puzzles, like, last last month or something? And so were working on, like, kind of training some of these Slack bots to essentially be the the first party provider of a of these answers, which makes the company as a whole a lot more data informed\" \n\nComprehensive Tool Landscape:\n\"The designers love Figma, so theyre using Figma Make. The engineers are using a combination of tools right now, so Cursor, Cloud Code, GitHub Copilot. Marketing teams use all sorts of tools for translation, subtitles, you know, content adaptations, etc. Customer support uses Intercom, VIN.\" \n\nChatGPT for Analysis and Decision Support\n\"You can just plug in, like, an analysis that another person wrote and just have it summarized for you and give you advice on, you know, ideas to go try.\" \n\nDylan Field, @zoink (CEO of Figma)\nProfessional Research \n\"Beyond the obvious, I think there are certain domains where it does really well. And I definitely like oftentimes will ask an AI model about a legal question now before I call a lawyer because I find its not replacing my call with a great lawyer, but it does inform my point of view. You have to be careful about when you do that, your conversation with AI is not the same as your conversation with the lawyer. But I think that any place where youre going to consult an expert but can come in more informed, that is interesting.\" \n\nCreative Exploration - Possibility Spaces \n\"Another thing thats not day to day but I find its very good at and this is underexplored is whenever you have a space of possibility and there are many dimensions to that space. So lets say I'm trying to write fiction and I want to go generate a character, for example. And theres a 100 personality traits that this character could have. Well, I could manually pick, come from a list myself or I can say, okay, randomly pick six out of this list of 100 and then give me basically for every attribute the full table of toggle that attribute positive, negative, and then all the combinations of that. And then give it a title and give it a description. Now Ive got a full table of, for those six traits, the entire possibility space of what that character sample might look like. It just builds intuition about a possibilities based in a different way if you do that. So thats something that I think is a process that people could learn from it in a depth more.\" \n\nEthan Smith, @ethan_graphite (CEO of Graphite, SEO expert)\nContent Strategy and Keyword Research\n\"First, I would figure out which questions I wanna rank for. How I would figure out which questions I wanna rank for, I would take my search data. I would maybe take my paid search data. Like, what are my money terms? What are my competitors money terms? So if I'm rippling, what is https://t.co/EIXoPX7ycu bidding all their paid search on? Then I would transform those into questions. And, actually, you can just give those keywords to ChatGPT and say, make these into questions, and it does a pretty good job. So take your competitors paid search data or mine or your own, Put it in ChatGPT, get the questions...\" \n\nAI-Generated Content\n\"AI assisted content edited is great. We do that sometimes. Other people do that. That is clearly the future of content. So that that does work and should work, and that's good. But purely 100% AI generated does not work.\" \n\nEzinne Udezue, @ezinneudezue (Former CPO at WP Engine)\nFashion recommendation project\nEzinne shared a story about helping an older woman: \"One particular woman, older lady, wanted to figure this out... she started a project where she actually had she took the time to take all her tops, all her bottoms, all her dresses, all her shoes. And now shes working on based on the temperature, having recommendations of her outfit for the day.\" \n\nOji Udezue, @ojiudezue (Former CPO at Calendly, Typeform)\nHome Automation Project \n\"The idea is that I give the house eyes and ears, and it senses the the coolest thing is I've specked out what I call, like, a super sensor. It will see people. It will feel their heat. It will hear them. It will sense humidity and temperature, and it it'll just be scattered around the house. Alright? And I'm building the hardware myself. And, basically, as you walk into the house, it starts to adapt itself to you. Right? It manages energy in the house. It knows you're in a room. If you leave, my kids are not in their in in their rooms right now. Well, the HVAC around them just stopped and said, no. They're not here. They when they come back before they come back, an hour before they come back, it starts to precool their space.\" \n\n\"So multiple levels. There's this open source software called Home Assistant that I use, and you can... it's very extensible. So I can put in, like, fine tune LLMs. I can use the big LLMs. They they they there are things like smaller, like, spoken whisper models you can use to like, I can just say, hey, Jarvis, like Iron Man, and it it'll the house will start talking to me and telling me things about what's going on. So things like that.\"",

    "note_tweet_text": "Your users are copy-pasting AI outputs into your product every day. Each paste is a validated demand signal you're probably ignoring.\n\nUsers don't lie with their actions. When they consistently copy text from ChatGPT into your CRM, email tool, or project management platform, they're voting with their workflow.\n\nThe copy-paste moment shows you 3 things: what AI task they're doing, why your product can't handle it natively, and how much friction they'll tolerate to get the job done.\n\nTrack these handoff patterns. Set up user session recordings focused on paste events. Most tools can flag when users paste large text blocks from external sources.\n\nLook for the repetitive patterns. One user pasting AI-generated emails is interesting. Hundreds doing it weekly is a product opportunity screaming for attention.\n\nThe highest-value integrations eliminate the most frequent copy-paste workflows. Email drafting, content summarization, data analysis, and creative brainstorming top the list for most products.\n\nUsers already proved they want the feature by building their own workaround. You're not validating demand, you're capturing it before someone else does.\n\nMap the full workflow, not just the paste moment. Where do they start in the AI tool? What prompts do they use? How do they modify the output before pasting?\n\nThe integration doesn't need to be complex. Sometimes a simple 'Generate with AI' button that opens a contextual prompt interface captures 80% of the value.\n\nTiming matters. Users develop copy-paste habits quickly but abandon them just as fast when friction gets too high. Move while the behavior is still growing.\n\nYour biggest competitor is the user deciding your tool isn't worth the copy-paste friction.",

But if one was self-taught, one might have never understood what the point of FA was, or even have been aware of its existence, and instead used kludgy, inept methods.\n\nFor a personal example, I was once given the job of taking the graphic display on a CRT and mapping it onto a printer page. The addressing was different, the axes were different, the pixels/per inch were different. I knew what the tool was - a transformation matrix. Had it ginned up in an hour and it worked first try.\n\nA co-worker was completely baffled at this. He didn't know what a transformation matrix was, and likely would have otherwise spent a couple weeks on the problem and done a crappy job.\n\nI.e. one doesn't know what one doesn't know. The advantage of an accredited degree program is the curriculum is selected by people who know what you need to know, and the order in which information is best presented.",

As you have fun, remember it's okay to also be serious and visualize the end goal. believe in that finished product, and pitch confidently!\n\nthat's how i operate. it might be different to each person, but i'm honored to share as best as i can with the community",

Debugging with AI. When something breaks, I don\u2019t just ask \u201cfix this.\u201d\nI copy logs or errors into ChatGPT, ask what\u2019s happening, and make sure I understand why. This has definitely helped me with me build better products.\n\n3. I always, always change the font from the default font the tool generates (usually Inter). I go to Google Fonts and pick my favorite, then prompt the tool to use it.\n\n4. Dribbble, Mobbin, and Coolors are great resources for design choices. Browse for a while to get some ideas. \n\n5. Sync to GitHub. Great for version control and backups. \n\n6. You don\u2019t need to use a fully custom domain, but at bare minimum edit the subdomain assigned to your project so that it meshes with what your project actually does.\n\n7. Implement RLS (row level security). To put it simply, RLS prevents users from seeing data that isn\u2019t theirs. It\u2019s necessary for user protection.\n\n8. Update your Open Graph Tags. Basically a way of making sure your project displays properly when shared or in search results. Typically found in project settings, or you can prompt your tool to update them.",

The truth? I didn\u2019t need more time. \n\nI needed focus.\n\nHere\u2019s how I finally learned to choose what to build each quarter, even with just 30 minutes to 2 hours a day.\n\nThe Real Problem: Endless Options, Limited Energy\n\nAI tools make it easier than ever to start building, but they also make it easier to get lost. One day it\u2019s an AI note app, the next it\u2019s a productivity bot. You start fast, but never finish.\n\nHere\u2019s why most side builders stall out:\n\n- They chase too many ideas.\n- They don\u2019t define what \u201cdone\u201d looks like.\n- They pick something exciting, not meaningful.\n- They don\u2019t plan around their real life, fatigue, family, work.\n\nBut clarity fixes all of that.\n\nStep 1: Brain Dump Everything\n\nList every idea, every feature, every dream. \nDon\u2019t judge. Get it out of your head and onto paper.\n\nThen ask: If I could build only one thing in the next 12 weeks, what would have the biggest impact?\n\nStep 2: Pick One or Two Goals\n\nUse this filter:\n\n- Excitement: Would I still want to build this when I\u2019m tired?\n- Impact: Will it move me closer to freedom or income?\n- Feasibility: Can I realistically complete this task in 12 weeks with 1 hour of work per day?\n\nFor me, that meant:\n\n- Build an Insight Engine at my  9-5 job\n- Grow Sucana to 10\u201350 paid users\n- Grow my YouTube channel\n\nStep 3: Define Your Why and Plan for Blockers\n\nYour \u201cwhy\u201d keeps you coding when motivation fades. Your blockers, distractions, new tools, and long days.\n\nWhen you only have 1 hour a day, the right focus is everything.\n\nBecause building your dream isn\u2019t about finding time, it\u2019s about choosing what deserves it.",

predict, sample, append\n- over and over, one token at a time\n- rinse and repeat\n- each new token depends on everything before it; the model re-reads the sequence every step\n\n- generation is always stepwise: token by token, not all at once\n- mathematically: model is a learned function, f_\u03b8(seq) \u2192 p(next_token)\n- all the \"magic\" is just repeating \"what's likely next?\" until you stop\n\n- all conversation \"tokens\" live in the KV cache, or the \"session memory\"\n\n- so what's actually inside the model?\n- everything above-tokens, weights, config-is just setup for the real engine underneath\n\n- the core of almost every modern llm is a transformer architecture\n- this is the skeleton that moves all those numbers around\n- it's what turns token sequences and weights into predictions\n- designed for sequence data (like language),\n- transformers can \"look back\" at previous tokens and\n- decide which ones matter for the next prediction\n\n- transformers work in layers, passing your sequence through the same recipe over and over\n- each layer refines the representation, using attention to focus on the important parts of your input and context\n- every time you generate a new token, it goes through this stack of layers-every single step\n\n- inside each transformer layer:\n- self-attention: figures out which previous tokens are important to the current prediction\n- MLPs (multi-layer perceptrons): further process token representations, adding non-linearity and expressiveness\n- layer norms and residuals: stabilize learning and prediction, making deep networks possible\n- positional encodings (like RoPE): tell the model where each token sits in the sequence\n- so \"cat\" and \"catastrophe\" aren't confused by position\n\n- by stacking these layers (sometimes dozens or even hundreds)\n- transformers build a complex understanding of your prompt, context, and conversation history\n\n- transformer recap:\n- decoder-only: model only predicts what comes next, each token looks back at all previous tokens\n- self-attention picks what to focus on (MQA/GQA = efficient versions for less memory)\n- feed-forward MLP after attention for every token (usually 2 layers, GELU activation)\n- everything's wrapped in layer norms + linear layers (QKV projections, MLPs, outputs)\n- residuals + norms = stable, trainable, no exploding/vanishing gradients\n- RoPE (rotary embeddings): tells the model where each token sits in the sequence\n- stack N layers of this \u2192 final logits \u2192 pick the next token\n- scale up: more layers, more heads, wider MLPs = bigger brains\n\n- VRAM: memory, the bottleneck\n- VRAM must must fit:\n1. weights (main model, whether quantized or not)\n2. KV cache (per token, per layer, per head)\n- weights:\n- FP16: ~2 bytes/param \u2192 7B = ~14GB\n- 8-bit: ~1 byte/param \u2192 7B = ~7GB\n- 4-bit: ~0.5 byte/param \u2192 7B = ~3.5GB\n- add 10\u201330% for runtime overheads\n- KV cache:\n- rule of thumb: 0.5MB per token (Llama-like 7B, 32 layers, 4K tokens = ~2GB)\n- some runtimes support KV cache quantization (8/4-bit) = big savings\n\n- throughput = memory bandwidth + GPU FLOPs + attention implementation (FlashAttention/SDPA help) + quantization + batch size\n- offload to CPU? expect MASSIVE slowdown\n\n- GPU or bust: CPUs run quantized models (slow), but any real context/model needs CUDA/ROCm/Metal\n- CPU spill = sadness (check device_map and memory fit)\n\n- quantization: reduce precision for memory wins (sometimes a tiny quality hit)\n- FP32/FP16/BF16 = full/floored\n- INT8/INT4/NF4 = quantized\n- 4-bit (NF4/GPTQ/AWQ) = sweet spot for most consumer GPUs (big memory win, small quality hit for most tasks)\n- math-heavy or finicky tasks degrade first (math, logic, coding)\n\n- KV cache quantization: even more memory saved for long contexts (check runtime support)\n\n- formats/runtimes:\n- PyTorch + safetensors: flexible, standard, GPU/TPU/CPU\n- GGUF (llama.cpp): CPU/GPU/portable, best for quant + edge devices\n- ONNX, TensorRT-LLM, MLC: advanced flavors for special hardware/use\n- protip: avoid legacy .bin (pickle risk), use safetensors for safety\n\n- everything is a tradeoff\n- smaller = fits anywhere, less power\n- more context = more latency + VRAM burn\n- quantization = speed/memory, but maybe less accurate\n- local = more control/knobs, more work\n\n- what happens when you \"load a model\"?\n- download weights, tokenizer, config\n- resolve license/trust (don't use trust_remote_code unless you really trust the author)\n- load to VRAM/CPU (check memory fit)\n- warmup: kernels/caches initialized, first pass is slowest\n- inference: forward passes per token, updating KV cache each step\n\n- decoding = how next token is chosen:\n- greedy: always top-1 (robotic)\n- temperature: softens or sharpens probabilities (higher = more random)\n- top-k: pick from top k\n- top-p: pick from smallest set with \u2265p prob\n- typical sampling, repetition penalty, no-repeat n-gram: extra controls\n- deterministic = set a seed and no sampling\n- tune for your use-case: chat, summarization, code\n\n- serving options?\n- vLLM for high throughput, parallel serving\n- llama.cpp server (OpenAI-compatible API)\n- ExLlama V2/V3 w/ Tabby API (OpenAI-compatible API)\n- run as a local script (CLI)\n- FastAPI/Flask for local API endpoint\n\n- local \u2260 offline; run it, serve it, or build apps on top\n\n- fine-tuning, ultra-brief:\n- LoRA / QLoRA = adapter layers (efficient, minimal VRAM)\n- still need a dataset and eval plan; adapters can be merged or kept separate\n- most users get far with prompting + retrieval (RAG) or few-shot for niche tasks\n\n- common pitfalls\n- OOM? out of memory. Model or context too big, quantize or shrink context\n- gibberish? used a base model with a chat prompt, or wrong template; check temperature/top_p\n- slow? offload to CPU, wrong drivers, no FlashAttention; check CUDA/ROCm/Metal, memory fit\n- unsafe? don't use random .bin or trust_remote_code; prefer safetensors, verify source\n\n- why run locally?\n- control: all the knobs are yours to tweak:\n- sampler, chat templates, decoding, system prompts, quantization, context\n- cost: no per-token API billing-just upfront hardware\n- privacy: prompts and outputs stay on your machine\n- latency: no network roundtrips, instant token streaming\n\n- challenges:\n- hardware limits (VRAM/memory = max model/context)\n- ecosystem variance (different runtimes, quant schemes, templates)\n- ops burden (setup, drivers, updates)\n\n- running local checklist:\n- pick a model (prefer chat-tuned, sized for your VRAM)\n- pick precision (4-bit saves RAM, FP16 for max quality)\n- install runtime (vLLM, llama.cpp, Transformers+PyTorch, etc)\n- run it, get tokens/sec, check memory fit\n- use correct chat template (apply_chat_template)\n- tune decoding (temp/top_p)\n- benchmark on your task\n- serve as local API (or go wild and fine-tune it)\n\n- glossary:\n- token: smallest unit (subword/char)\n- context window: max tokens visible to model\n- KV cache: session memory, per-layer attention state\n- quantization: lower precision for memory/speed\n- RoPE: rotary position embeddings (for order)\n- GQA/MQA: efficient attention for memory bandwidth\n- decoding: method for picking next token\n- RAG: retrieval-augmented generation, add real info\n\n- misc:\n- common architectures: LLaMA, Falcon, Mistral, GPT-NeoX, etc\n- base model: not fine-tuned for chat (LLaMA, Falcon, etc)\n- chat-tuned: fine-tuned for dialogue (Alpaca, Vicuna, etc)\n- instruct-tuned: fine-tuned for following instructions (LLaMA-2-Chat, Mistral-Instruct, etc)\n\n- chat/instruct models usually need a special prompt template to work well\n- chat template: system/user/assistant markup is required; wrong template = junk output\n- base models can do few-shot chat prompting, but not as well as chat-tuned ones\n\n- quantized: weights stored in lower precision (8-bit, 4-bit) for memory savings, at some quality loss\n- quantization is a tradeoff: memory/speed vs quality\n- 4-bit (NF4/GPTQ/AWQ) is the sweet spot for most consumer GPUs (huge memory win, minor quality drop for most tasks)\n- math-heavy or finicky tasks degrade first (math, logic, code)\n- quantization types: FP16 (full), INT8 (quantized), INT4/NF4 (more quantized), etc.\n- some runtimes support quantized KV cache (8/4-bit), big savings for long contexts\n\n- formats/runtimes:\n- PyTorch + safetensors: flexible, standard, works on GPU/TPU/CPU\n- GGUF (llama.cpp): CPU/GPU, portable, best for quant + edge devices\n- ONNX, TensorRT-LLM, MLC: advanced options for special hardware\n\n- avoid legacy .bin (pickle risk), use safetensors for safety\n\n- everything is a tradeoff:\n- smaller = fits anywhere, less power\n- more context = more latency + VRAM burn\n- quantization = faster/leaner, maybe less accurate\n- local = full control/knobs, but more work\n\n- final words:\n- local LLMs = memory math + correct formatting\n- fit weights and KV cache in memory\n- use the right chat template and decoding strategy\n- know your knobs: quantization, context, decoding, batch, hardware\n\n- master these, and you can run (and reason about) almost any modern model locally",
