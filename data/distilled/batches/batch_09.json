Context engineering is the new game, and it changes everything about building AI agents \ud83e\udd16\n\nFor years, we obsessed over the perfect prompt.\n\nThe right words. The perfect phrasing. The magic sentence that makes GPT-4 finally understand what you want.\n\nBut Anthropic just dropped a reality check:\n\nPrompts are the easy part. Context is the bottleneck.\n\nHere's what they found:\n\n\u2192 LLMs have an \"attention budget\" like human working memory, but for tokens\n\u2192 More context = worse performance (they call it \"context rot\")\n\u2192 The transformer architecture creates n\u00b2 relationships between tokens\n\u2192 Every token you add depletes focus exponentially\n\nTranslation? Stuffing your AI with information is like trying to focus while 50 people scream at you.\n\nSo what's the new playbook?\n\n\u21b3 Just-in-time retrieval\n- Instead of loading everything upfront, agents pull data dynamically using tools\n- Claude Code does this brilliantly: it uses grep, head, tail to analyze databases without ever loading full files into context\n\n\u21b3 Compaction\n- Summarize the conversation when you hit limits\n- Keep architectural decisions, discard redundant tool outputs\n- Maintain continuity without context bloat\n\n\u21b3 Structured note-taking\n- Agents write persistent notes outside the context window\n- Pull them back only when needed\n- Think: AI maintaining its own https://t.co/xZDZxFLBJK file\n\n\u21b3 Sub-agent architectures\n- Specialized agents handle focused tasks\n- Return compressed summaries (2k tokens) instead of raw exploration (50k+ tokens)\n- Separation of concerns at the AI level\n\nThe shift is profound:\n\nBefore: \"How do I write the perfect prompt?\"\nNow: \"What's the minimal high-signal context that drives my desired outcome?\"\n\nThis isn't just academic.\n\nGoldman Sachs is using AI to draft S1s.\nPerplexity is automating financial analysis.\nClaude Code is refactoring entire codebases.\n\nNone of this works if you drown the AI in context.\n\nThe best AI engineers aren't prompt wizards anymore.\n\nThey're context architects.",

Think in broad buckets\n2. Determine primary aspect to measure\n3. Think of questions you want to answer\n4. Find a metric that answers the question\n5. Avoid common mistakes\n\nFor ex: in this chart -- I would focus on answering each question with a metric that is simple, easy-to-understand for others, and actionable.\n--\n\nWhat would you you improve in this approach?\n\nWhat approach do you use?",

Not responding.\n\nJunior PM: What else is there?\n\nSenior PM: You could understand why priorities shifted.\n\nJunior PM: I know why. The CEO wants to chase a new market.\n\nSenior PM: Do you understand the business case?\n\nJunior PM: Not really my level...\n\nSenior PM: There it is.\n\nJunior PM: There's what?\n\nSenior PM: Your cage. \"Not my level.\"\n\nJunior PM: But I'm just a PM. I don't make strategy.\n\nSenior PM: You don't make it. Can you influence it?\n\nJunior PM: How would I influence the CEO?\n\nSenior PM: Not the CEO. The decision.\n\nJunior PM: ...I could build a stronger case for our feature?\n\nSenior PM: Keep going.\n\nJunior PM: Show how our feature actually helps enter that new market?\n\nSenior PM: Now you're thinking with agency.\n\nJunior PM: But what if they still say no?\n\nSenior PM: Then you find another angle.\n\nJunior PM: That sounds exhausting.\n\nSenior PM: Know what's more exhausting?\n\nJunior PM: What?\n\nSenior PM: Being brilliant but powerless.\n\nJunior PM: So High Agency means never accepting \"no\"?\n\nSenior PM: High Agency means never accepting \"nothing I can do.\"\n\nJunior PM: There's always something?\n\nSenior PM: Always. Even if it's just changing your approach.\n\nJunior PM: My last manager would say \"pick your battles.\"\n\nSenior PM: Your last manager was teaching you to be mediocre.\n\nJunior PM: Harsh.\n\nSenior PM: True. Watch the best PMs. They don't pick battles. They pick outcomes.\n\nJunior PM: And they just... make them happen?\n\nSenior PM: They find ways. Legal ways. Ethical ways. Creative ways.\n\nJunior PM: Even when the deck is stacked against them?\n\nSenior PM: Especially then. That's when High Agency matters most.\n\nJunior PM: Give me an example.\n\nSenior PM: Remember when Slack couldn't get IT approval at companies?\n\nJunior PM: Yeah?\n\nSenior PM: They didn't whine about IT gatekeepers. They made a product that spread without IT.\n\nJunior PM: That's a company. I'm one person.\n\nSenior PM: Every high agency move starts with one person refusing to be blocked.\n\nJunior PM: What if I try everything and still fail?\n\nSenior PM: You'll fail forward. Low Agency people fail in place.\n\nJunior PM: This is basically \"extreme ownership\" right?\n\nSenior PM: It's beyond ownership. Ownership says \"this is my responsibility.\"\n\nJunior PM: And High Agency?\n\nSenior PM: High Agency says \"I'll find a way regardless.\"\n\nJunior PM: So when engineering says they need 6 months...\n\nSenior PM: You explore what would make it 3.\n\nJunior PM: When design is bottlenecked...\n\nSenior PM: You learn enough to unblock progress.\n\nJunior PM: When sales wants features we shouldn't build...\n\nSenior PM: You find what they really need and solve it differently.\n\nJunior PM: This is just doing everyone's job.\n\nSenior PM: No. It's refusing to let their constraints become your excuses.\n\nJunior PM: How do I know if I'm being High Agency or just stubborn?\n\nSenior PM: High Agency people change tactics constantly. Stubborn people bang their heads on the same wall.\n\nJunior PM: So flexibility in method, rigidity in outcome?\n\nSenior PM: Exactly.\n\nJunior PM: What's the biggest High Agency move you've seen?\n\nSenior PM: A PM whose product got killed. Instead of sulking, they analyzed why, found a adjacent problem, built a prototype on weekends, and got it funded.\n\nJunior PM: That's insane effort.\n\nSenior PM: That's High Agency.\n\nJunior PM: I count at least five times this week I said \"can't do anything about that.\"\n\nSenior PM: Good. Awareness is step one.\n\nJunior PM: What's step two?\n\nSenior PM: Next time you think \"can't,\" ask \"what if I had to?\"\n\nJunior PM: Like if my job depended on it?\n\nSenior PM: Like if someone you loved depended on it.\n\nJunior PM: That changes the equation.\n\nSenior PM: High Agency people live in that equation.\n\nJunior PM: This sounds like a recipe for burnout.\n\nSenior PM: Low Agency is the real burnout. Years of blaming \"the system\" while going nowhere.\n\nJunior PM: At least High Agency burnout means you tried.\n\nSenior PM: High Agency rarely burns out. It builds momentum.\n\nJunior PM: Because you're actually making progress?\n\nSenior PM: Because you're writing your story, not reading someone else's script.\n\nJunior PM: Even in a big company with process and politics?\n\nSenior PM: Especially there. That's where High Agency becomes a superpower.",
