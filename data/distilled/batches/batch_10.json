    "note_tweet_text": "I recently wrote a post sharing my experience with Big Tech jobs.\n\nOver there, I promised to share my notes on System Design preparation.\n\nSo here I am documenting couple points that have worked for me & people I know.\n\nCaution:\n\n> Getting good at System Design is a long term pursuit.\nI am still doing it! Only way to get more knowledge is to ask fundamental questions.\n\n> Interviewing for System Design is not the same as being an expert at it. You may be a great architect, but if you aren't able to portray all the signal in time, you'll fail.\nYou need to practice on delivering what is needed in a digestible format.\n\nResources:\n(I am only recommending the ones I have used myself)\n\n> donnemartin/system-design-primer. Search this on Github. Read all of it. This will give you a thorough overview of the entire syllabus.\nYou can't learn something if you don't know about it.\nSo find things that you don't know about.\nDo selective readings of the resources that are mentioned here.\n\n> Alex Xu (@alexxubyte) Vol 1 & 2.\nThis is the where you will have to spend the majority of your time. Re read these 2 times atleast.\nThe best part about these books are the structured approach & citations. It is the extract of so many trade offs & question that the author has considered.\nYou will learn to ask the right questions by going through it. \nI HIGHLY recommend this.\n\n> Jordan has no life - Search this YouTube channel & go through the conceptual playlist & questions you find interesting. The coverage can seem a bit based towards specific technology, but you will balance your approach since you have read Alex Xu.\nStill an amazing educator who talks about the concept in a fun & simple way.\nI recommend this to be done after Alex Xu is done 2 times & you start getting independent design thoughts.\n\n> Designing Data Intensive Applications by Kleppmann (@martinkl). This is one of my favorite reference books on the subject. \nHowever, I recommend it to be read selectively over time. Read & re-read.\nKleppmann also has a great YT videos on the subject, you can refer those too.\nMake sure when you learn a concept here, try to connect it to the concepts you already know.\n\n> Company engineering blogs & deep dives: Ex: Google, Microsoft, Uber, Datadog, Netflix etc.\n\n> There are great newsletter that I read sometimes. @bytebytego, @systemdesignone & @Franc0Fernand0 \n\nPointers on how to prepare:\n\n> Cover the above literature in depth, ask questions to yourself about the material that you are learning.\nDon't just cram things. You should be able to justify ever design choice that you are reading about.\n\n> You'll forget things here a lot. Revising is not cramming. It is just you trying to make the retrieval of information easier.\nPrepare some notes explaining the concepts in the simple terms.\nEx: If you find it difficult to understand Paxos. Spend sometime understanding it, then make a small note that can bring you up to speed in couple minutes.\n\n> Pace yourself, don't try to do all the resources ALL AT ONCE! You won't be able to sustain it.\nInstead cover a single resource so that you get an idea of the entire subject at a decent level.\nThen move over to the other resource to dig deeper.\n\n> MOCKS! You'll realize how fast the time moves. This way you'll be able to better pace yourselves in the interviews. \nIf you don't do mocks, you are going to FAIL!\n\n> When you start a question, try to follow a structured approach. You will get the examples in Alex Xu books. Try to develop a structure that works for you.\nHowever, don't be rigid on this. Improvise in the interview according to what is being asked.\n\n> Listen to the interviewer about the part where they want to dive deeper. Lead them there, give them what they are looking for. \nBE PROACTIVE THAN REACTIVE!\nAct like a design lead in the discussion.\nExplain tradeoffs.\n\n> Get a soft sign off from the interviewer at regular intervals. You don't want to get blind sided at the end of the interview here.\nSo check in regularly to see if the interviewer is aligned with the discussion or if they want you to focus/talk about something else in the design.\n\n> Don't skip the back of the envelop calculations unless asked.\n\n> When you are practicing, do it for the entire process, not just the High Level design part. You'll realize that often you lose time in the other sections, like designing APIs or the Database Schema, so practice accordingly.\n\n> The most important System Design that you'll discuss will be about your own work projects. Ensure that you deep dive into that with the same rigor you prepare for the other questions.\n\n> Scope down your design if you feel that the question is pretty broad. The ambiguity is intentional in the interview.\nIf you can't design the entire system, try to focus on a subset of the problem or make the constraints loose.\nOfcourse! Communicate this to the interviewer.\n\nSystem Design demands curiosity. Don't just try to remember information without actively engaging in it.\n\nWhile you need to prepare for interviews on a schedule, there is no substitute for slow cooking these concepts.\n\nRead them often, even when you need them, let them simmer.\n\nFeel free to post your questions below.\nLet me know how it goes.\nGood luck. \ud83d\ude80",

    "note_tweet_text": "Everyone teaching automation is lying to you.\n\nYou don't need to know n8n. You don't need to code.\n\nA kid DM'd me 3 weeks ago basically saying \"make me money.\" Zero skills. Zero experience.\n\nYesterday he closed his first $8K deal. Still can't explain what a webhook is.\n\nHere's exactly what I told him:\n\nStop learning automation. Start selling it.\n\nThe entire industry wants you to \"master n8n first\" or \"learn make\" or whatever. That's backwards. That's why you're broke.\n\nHere's the actual playbook:\n\n1. Find businesses first. Walk into any dentist, accountant, or restaurant. Say it's for a university project if you're nervous. Ask one question: \"What tasks waste 2+ hours of your day?\"\n\n2. LISTEN. Don't pitch. Don't mention automation. Just understand their daily hell. Dentists? Admin nightmare. Hair salons? Booking chaos. Every business has something they hate doing.\n\n3. Leave. Go home. Open ChatGPT/Claude. Type: \"How would I automate [their exact problem]?\" Get a basic solution. Don't overcomplicate it.\n\n4. Go back with confidence. Say: \"I can make that 2-hour task take 2 minutes.\" Show them on paper. Not technical. Just \"this happens automatically instead of manually.\"\n\n5. Get paid FIRST. Always. \"It'll be $5K to set this up.\" They'll either pay or they won't. If they won't, next business. Don't build anything for free.\n\n6. NOW figure out how to build it. Use https://t.co/quiv0cThVU - type what you want in plain English, it builds the n8n workflow. Or pay someone $200 on Upwork to build it while you keep $4,800.\n\nThat kid I mentioned?\nWeek 1: Talked to 6 businesses\nWeek 2: Got 3 interested\nWeek 3: Closed one for $8K\nWeek 4: Delivered using Synta (took 4 hours)\n\nHe still doesn't know what JSON means.\n\nThe tools available now are insane. Synta builds automations from descriptions. Claude explains everything. You can run a 10-person agency as one person.\n\nBut everyone's learning tools instead of talking to humans with money.\n\nStop studying. Start selling.\n\nThe market doesn't care about your certifications. It cares about their problems disappearing.\n\nDrop a comment and I'll send you the full breakdown of exactly how this kid went from zero to $8K\n\nTime to make your first $10K.",
