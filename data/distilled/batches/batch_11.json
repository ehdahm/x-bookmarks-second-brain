They tried, hit limitations, & then ultimately ended up hiring professionals.\n\nSame with QuickBooks and accountants. LegalZoom and lawyers.\n\nThe tools didn't kill the professionals - they expanded the market.\n\nSmall businesses try the DIY route, realize it's harder than it looks, and then desperately need experts.\n\nWe're seeing this exact pattern with AI.\n\nSo at Morningside AI, we've been quietly testing something new for 9 months.\n\nInstead of competing on development (much smaller market than consulting rn), we became AI Transformation Partners:\n\n\u2022 Strategy & roadmapping first\n\u2022 Team education\n\u2022 THEN development (and long-term partnership)\n\nOur first audit was free - lost $30k on it but learned a ton.\n\nSecond one: $30k for 6 weeks.\n\nThird one: $60k for 4 weeks.\n\nThe companies we work with aren\u2019t focused on code (yet) - they want someone to tell them WHERE to apply AI and HOW to not fail.\n\nIt\u2019s a lot harder than it sounds but it\u2019s where we\u2019re putting our money.\n\nHere\u2019s how we see it:\n\nAI consulting is projected to go from $8.8B to $73B by 2033 (~30% year-on-year growth).\n\nAnd when 78% of SMBs want AI solutions, but only 5% have consultants\u2026\n\nWe want to be their transformation partners.",

    "note_tweet_text": "If you are a backend engineer, you have to understand SOLID principle without any exception. I have received multiple dms asking me to explain it in an understandable way. So here we go. Save this, you'll thank me later.\n\nSOLID is a set of five design principles that help developers create software that is easy to maintain, understand, and extend. Think of this like rules for building with lego bricks, and shouldn't fall apart when you add a new piece.\n\n\u2192S - Single Responsibility Principle\nA class should have only one job or one reason to change.\n How I remember: A screwdriver is designed to drive screws. It's not also a hammer and a saw. If you make it do too many things, it becomes complex and hard to use properly.\n\n\u2192O - Open/Closed Principle\nSoftware should be open for extension, but closed for modification. Means one should be able to add new features without changing the existing, tested code.\nHow I remember: Your phone is \"closed\" because you can't change its core operating system. But it's \"open\" cause one can extend its functionality by installing new apps from the Play/App Store without breaking the phone.\n\n\u2192L - Liskov Substitution Principle\nIf you have a class A, any class B that inherits from A should be able to replace A without causing any errors. In short, child classes should be perfectly substitutable for their parent classes.\nHow I remember: If you have a universal remote control designed for a \"TV,\" it should work whether you're pointing it at a Samsung TV or an LG TV. You can substitute one type of TV for another, and the remote still works as expected\n\n\u2192I - Interface Segregation Principle \nClients should not be forced to depend on interfaces or methods they do not use. It's better to have many small, specific interfaces than one large, general-purpose one.\nHow I remember: When you go to a restaurant, you don't get one giant menu with every food item in the world. You get a breakfast menu, a lunch menu, or a dessert menu. You only see what's relevant to you at that moment\n\n\u2192D - Dependency Inversion Principle\nHigh-level modules (your main business logic) should not depend on low-level modules (like a specific database or a payment gateway). Both should depend on abstractions (like a generic Database interface).\nHow I remember: You don't wire a lamp directly into your house's electrical system. Instead, the lamp has a standard plug, and your wall has a standard socket. The plug and socket (the abstraction) allow you to switch out the lamp for any other appliance without rewiring your house.",

The client generates a unique key for each operation and sends it in a custom header.\n\n2. The server checks if it has seen this key before\n- For a new key, process the request and store the result\n- For a known key, return the stored result without reprocessing\n\nHow do you implement this in .NET?\n\nStart here: https://t.co/ARcHwy1xLC\n\nAre you handling idempotency in your APIs?\n\nP.S.
