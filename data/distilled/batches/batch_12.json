Boston tech postings down 51%. Austin is down 28%.\n\nThe difference? Local economic health. Austin's non-tech jobs grew 11%. Boston fell 8%.\n\nTexas and Southeast metros held up. Seattle, Minneapolis, and San Francisco experienced significant declines alongside their broader economies.\n\nSo, remote-first companies bypass geography.

This shift started after ChatGPT launched.\n\nEntry-level roles shrank to 18% of the market. Mid-tier positions ($ 100,000-$200,000) were the first to be eliminated.\n\nThe squeeze happened from both ends. Junior roles disappeared, and senior requirements inflated.\n\nWhat you can do: Count internships and side projects as experience. Apply at a 70% match rate.\n\n\ud835\udff0. \ud835\udde7\ud835\uddf5\ud835\uddf2 \ud835\uddf2\ud835\uddfb\ud835\ude01\ud835\uddf2\ud835\uddff\ud835\uddfd\ud835\uddff\ud835\uddf6\ud835\ude00\ud835\uddf2 \ud835\ude00\ud835\uddee\ud835\uddf3\ud835\uddf2\ud835\ude01\ud835\ude06 \ud835\uddfb\ud835\uddf2\ud835\ude01\n\nSAP consultants and Salesforce developers continued to hire.

The math is simple, but most engineers won't do it.\n\nSet quota: 15 targeted applications per week. Use the same resume. Customize only the cover letter's first line.\n\nIn the end, employment in tech remains up 19% from 2019, despite the hiring freeze. Current workers are fine. Job seekers are screwed.\n\nThis gap won't last. Either hiring rebounds or employment drops to match posting levels.\n\nImage: indeed",
