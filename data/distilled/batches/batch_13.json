    "note_tweet_text": "\"RAG is just fancy search\" - a quote that aged poorly.\n\nThe next frontier isn't just about better retrieval, it's about giving your RAG systems components that actually do more with your data.\n\nBuilding RAG is easy at this point, now, we need to start going beyond that and engineering systems that include techniques, components, and strategies to ensure deterministic success in LLM-based architectures. There\u2019s not a one-size-fits-all solution, it\u2019s all about figuring out what is going to actually work for your use case.\n\nSo here\u2019s a dump of some advanced prompting and reasoning techniques that can be applied to RAG pipelines:\n\n\ud835\uddd6\ud835\uddf5\ud835\uddee\ud835\uddf6\ud835\uddfb \ud835\uddfc\ud835\uddf3 \ud835\udde7\ud835\uddf5\ud835\uddfc\ud835\ude02\ud835\uddf4\ud835\uddf5\ud835\ude01 (\ud835\uddd6\ud835\uddfc\ud835\udde7): Instead of jumping straight to answers, the model breaks down complex queries into intermediate reasoning steps. This dramatically improves answer quality by making the LLM \"show its work.\"\n\n\ud835\udde5\ud835\uddf2\ud835\uddd4\ud835\uddf0\ud835\ude01 (\ud835\udde5\ud835\uddf2\ud835\uddee\ud835\ude00\ud835\uddfc\ud835\uddfb\ud835\uddf6\ud835\uddfb\ud835\uddf4 + \ud835\uddd4\ud835\uddf0\ud835\ude01\ud835\uddf6\ud835\uddfb\ud835\uddf4): Combines reasoning with action-taking capabilities. The agent can reason about what information it needs, act to retrieve it, then reason again based on what it found. \n\n\ud835\udde7\ud835\uddff\ud835\uddf2\ud835\uddf2 \ud835\uddfc\ud835\uddf3 \ud835\udde7\ud835\uddf5\ud835\uddfc\ud835\ude02\ud835\uddf4\ud835\uddf5\ud835\ude01\ud835\ude00: Takes reasoning even further by exploring multiple reasoning paths simultaneously. Each \"branch\" represents a different approach to solving the problem, allowing the system to find the most effective solution path.\n\n\ud835\udde4\ud835\ude02\ud835\uddf2\ud835\uddff\ud835\ude06 \ud835\udde5\ud835\uddf2\ud835\ude04\ud835\uddff\ud835\uddf6\ud835\ude01\ud835\uddf6\ud835\uddfb\ud835\uddf4 & \ud835\uddd8\ud835\ude05\ud835\uddfd\ud835\uddee\ud835\uddfb\ud835\ude00\ud835\uddf6\ud835\uddfc\ud835\uddfb: The system can reformulate user queries to be more effective for retrieval. Sometimes what users ask isn't the best way to find what they actually need. \n\nYou can find more in this ebook: https://t.co/4MGyGtwUND",

I scored everything but the results feel... wrong?\n\nSenior PM: What feels wrong about them?\n\nJunior PM: The feature everyone wants most scored lowest. The technical debt item scored highest.\n\nSenior PM: Let me guess. You gave technical debt high impact, high confidence, low effort?\n\nJunior PM: ...yes. How did you know?\n\nSenior PM: Because that's what everyone does. RICE becomes a game of making the scores fit what you want.\n\nJunior PM: But I tried to be objective.\n\nSenior PM: Objective about what? You literally made up the numbers.\n\nJunior PM: They're not made up. I thought carefully about each score.\n\nSenior PM: Based on what data?\n\nJunior PM: Well... my experience. And some user feedback.\n\nSenior PM: So your gut feelings, dressed up as math.\n\nJunior PM: That sounds worse when you say it like that.\n\nSenior PM: I'm not trying to be harsh. Every PM does this. We pretend frameworks make decisions scientific.\n\nJunior PM: So RICE is useless?\n\nSenior PM: RICE assumes you can quantify things you can't actually measure.\n\nJunior PM: Like what?\n\nSenior PM: \"Impact\" - on what metric, over what timeframe, for which user segment?\n\nJunior PM: I used MAU growth.\n\nSenior PM: How much MAU growth? How do you know that feature will drive it?\n\nJunior PM: I... estimated.\n\nSenior PM: You guessed. Then you gave your guess a number to make it look scientific.\n\nJunior PM: But frameworks are supposed to help with hard decisions.\n\nSenior PM: They're supposed to help you think through hard decisions. Not make them for you.\n\nJunior PM: What's the difference?\n\nSenior PM: One forces you to ask better questions. The other gives you fake answers.\n\nJunior PM: So how should I actually prioritize?\n\nSenior PM: Start with the questions the framework is trying to answer.\n\nJunior PM: Like what?\n\nSenior PM: RICE asks \"what has the highest expected value?\" That's a good question.\n\nJunior PM: And then?\n\nSenior PM: Then ask \"how confident am I in that expectation?\" without scoring it.\n\nJunior PM: Just... think about it?\n\nSenior PM: Think about it honestly. What could go wrong? What am I not seeing?\n\nJunior PM: But my manager wants the RICE scores.\n\nSenior PM: Give them the scores. But make your decision based on your actual judgment.\n\nJunior PM: Isn't that backwards?\n\nSenior PM: Welcome to product management. Half of it is translating your thinking into formats people expect.\n\nJunior PM: This is frustrating.\n\nSenior PM: What's frustrating is pretending bad frameworks are good because everyone uses them.\n\nJunior PM: So what frameworks do actually work?\n\nSenior PM: The ones that help you think, not the ones that think for you.\n\nJunior PM: Example?\n\nSenior PM: \"What problem does this solve, for whom, and how will we know it worked?\"\n\nJunior PM: That's not a framework, that's just questions.\n\nSenior PM: Exactly. Frameworks are just structured ways to ask good questions.\n\nJunior PM: But RICE is structured questions.\n\nSenior PM: RICE is structured guessing. Big difference.\n\nJunior PM: How do I tell the difference?\n\nSenior PM: Good frameworks force you to admit what you don't know. Bad ones let you pretend you know everything.\n\nJunior PM: RICE definitely doesn't make me admit ignorance.\n\nSenior PM: It makes ignorance look like analysis. That's worse than admitting you're guessing.\n\nJunior PM: So what do I tell my manager?\n\nSenior PM: Show them your RICE scores. Then explain your actual reasoning.\n\nJunior PM: And if they clash?\n\nSenior PM: That's when you have a real conversation about priorities instead of hiding behind fake math.\n\nJunior PM: This job is harder than I thought.\n\nSenior PM: It's easier once you stop pretending frameworks can think for you.",

Attention figures out exactly HOW important each word should be.\n\nHere's the beautiful math:\n\nAttention(Q, K, V) = softmax(QK^T / \u221ad_k)V\n\nBreaking it down:\n\nQ (Query): \"What am I looking for?\"\nK (Key): \"What info is available?\"\nV (Value): \"What is that info?\"\nd_k: Key dimension (for scaling)\n\nThink library analogy: \n\nYou have a question (Query). Books have titles (Keys) and content (Values). Attention finds which books are most relevant.\n\nStep-by-step with \"The cat sat on the mat\":\n\nStep 1: Create Q, K, VEach word \u2192 three vectors via learned matrices W_Q, W_K, W_V\nFor \"cat\":\n\nQuery: \"What should I attend to when processing 'cat'?\"\nKey: \"I am 'cat'\"\nValue: \"Here's cat info\"\n\nStep 2: Calculate scoresQK^T = how much each word should attend to others\n\nProcessing \"sat\"? High similarity with \"cat\" (cats sit) and \"mat\" (where sitting happens).\n\nStep 3: Scale by \u221ad_kPrevents dot products from getting too large, keeps softmax balanced.\n\nStep 4: SoftmaxConverts scores to probabilities:\n\n\"cat\": 0.4 (subject)\n\"sat\": 0.3 (action)\n\"mat\": 0.2 (location)\n\"on\": 0.1 (preposition)\n\"the\": 0.1 (article)\n\nStep 5: Weight valuesMultiply each word's value by attention weight, sum up. Now \"sat\" knows it's most related to \"cat\" and \"mat\".\n\nMulti-Head Magic:Transformers do this multiple times in parallel:\n\nHead 1: Subject-verb relationships\nHead 2: Spatial (\"on\", \"in\", \"under\")\nHead 3: Temporal (\"before\", \"after\")\nHead 4: Semantic similarity\n\nEach head learns different relationship types.\n\nWhy This Changed Everything:\n\nBefore: RNNs = reading with flashlight (one word at a time, forget the beginning)\n\nAfter: Attention = floodlights on entire sentence with dimmer switches\nThis is why ChatGPT can:\n\nRemember 50 messages ago\n\nKnow \"it\" refers to something specific\nUnderstand \"bank\" = money vs river based on context\nThe Kicker:Models learn these patterns from data alone. Nobody programmed grammar rules. It figured out language structure just by predicting next words.\nAttention is how AI learned to read between the lines.\n\nJust like my therapist helped me understand my focus patterns, maybe understanding transformers helps us see how we decide what matters.\n\nNow if only I could implement multi-head attention in dating... \ud83e\udd16\n\nStill waiting for \"scaled dot-product listening\" to be invented.",

    "note_tweet_text": "New episode: \"How Elon Works\"\n\nThis episode covers the insanely valuable company-building principles of Elon Musk\n\nA few notes from the episode:\n\n1. The mission comes first.\n\n2. Retreat is not an option.\n\n3. A maniacal sense of urgency is our operating principle.\n\n4. Product design should be driven by engineers.\n\n5. You should not separate engineering from product design.\n\n6. Having separate design and production departments is bullshit. Keep everything together and feedback immediate.\n\n7. The leader should be on the front lines. You should be a battlefield general.\n\n8. \"If they see the general out on the battlefield, the troops are going to be motivated. Wherever Napoleon was, that's where his armies would do best.\"\n\n9. Apply The Algorithm constantly. (1) Question every requirement. (2) Delete any part of the process you can. (3) Simplify and optimize. (4) Accelerate cycle time. (5) Automate.\n\n10. Repetition is persuasive. \"I became a broken record on the algorithm. I think it's helpful to say it to an annoying degree.\"\n\n11. You should go ultra-hardcore on deletion and simplification.\n\n12. Camaraderie is dangerous. It makes it hard for people to challenge each other\u2019s work. (Refer to point #1)\n\n13. Never ask your troops to do something you wouldn\u2019t do.\n\n14. Hire for attitude. Skills can be taught. Attitude changes require a brain transplant.\n\n15. Good attitude = A desire to work maniacally hard.\n\n16. The only rules are the ones dictated by the laws of physics. Everything else is a recommendation.\n\n17. Keep your entire company committed to a common goal.\n\n18. If things aren\u2019t going well, throw away the existing design, start from first principles, question every requirement based on fundamental physics.\n\n19. Find the limit. You want to delete as much as possible and you can\u2019t do that unless you find the limit.\n\n20. If you aren\u2019t adding back at least 10% of the things you deleted, then you didn\u2019t delete enough.\n\n21. Maintain control. Avoid joint ventures. Eliminate middlemen.\n\n22. Have a relentless dedication to questioning every requirement.\n\n23. No work about work, just work.\n\n24. Go to the problem. Get on the plane. Fly to the source. Go to the exact location in the factory. Go to the problem and stay there until it's resolved.\n\n25. The best part is no part.\n\n26. Be wired for war.\n\n27.  Do not fear losing. It hurts the first 50 times but then you\u2019ll be able to play with less emotion. You will take more risks.\n\n28. Stay heads down focused on doing useful things for civilization.\n\n29. When something is important and has to be done quickly, have meetings every 24 hours to run the algorithm and check on the previous days progress. You'll be shocked at how fast this speeds things up.\n\n30. Life needs to be interesting and edgy.\n\n31.  Delete, delete, delete, delete.\n\nThere are 100 more ideas in the episode. I hope you listen to it. 30 years of Elon\u2019s career + 60 hours of reading and research and me just absolutely ripping through idea after idea at 2x speed for 90 minutes.\n\nIt will be hard to find a better use of time.",
