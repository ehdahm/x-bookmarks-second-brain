Singleton - one instance, global access. Use carefully, avoid hidden state\n2. Factory Method - delegate object creation, hide\n3. Strategy - swap algorithms, remove if/else\n4\ufe0f. Template Method - fixed algorithm, customizable steps\n5\ufe0f. Observer - event subscription without tight coupling\n\nThese patterns help you write cleaner, more testable code from day one.\n\n\u27a1\ufe0f \ud835\udde0\ud835\uddf6\ud835\uddf1-\ud835\udddf\ud835\uddf2\ud835\ude03\ud835\uddf2\ud835\uddf9 \ud835\uddd7\ud835\uddf2\ud835\ude03\ud835\uddf2\ud835\uddf9\ud835\uddfc\ud835\uddfd\ud835\uddf2\ud835\uddff\n\nStep up by learning how to organize complexity and add flexibility.\n\n1. Builder - step-by-step creation of complex objects\n2. Facade - single entry to a messy subsystem\n3. Adapter - make third-party APIs fit your code\n4. Proxy - placeholder for access control, lazy load, or remote call\n5. Decorator - add responsibilities at runtime without subclassing\n6. Command - wrap actions as objects (queue, undo, log)\n7. State - model modes as classes instead of flags\n\nThese patterns teach you to simplify subsystems, extend behavior without inheritance, and model workflows safely.\n\n\u27a1\ufe0f \ud835\udde6\ud835\uddf2\ud835\uddfb\ud835\uddf6\ud835\uddfc\ud835\uddff \ud835\uddd7\ud835\uddf2\ud835\ude03\ud835\uddf2\ud835\uddf9\ud835\uddfc\ud835\uddfd\ud835\uddf2\ud835\uddff\n\nEvolve systems safely, and optimize for change and performance.\n\n1. Composite - treat part-whole hierarchies uniformly (menus, pricing, rules)\n2. Visitor - add operations across complex structures without editing each class\n3. Bridge - decouple abstraction from implementation; evolve independently\n4. Flyweight - share intrinsic state to cut memory for many similar objects\n5. Interpreter - small DSLs; parse/execute simple grammars\n\nAlso, at this level, the skill isn\u2019t about knowing more patterns; it\u2019s about choosing wisely. The hardest part is recognizing when NOT to use them.\n\nSo, remember, patterns are tools, not rules.\n\nThe wrong pattern at the wrong time creates complexity.\n\nThe right one, at the right time, makes your system flexible and future-proof.\n\n\u267b\ufe0f Reshare if you found this helpful\n\n#softwareengineering #programming #developers",

    "note_tweet_text": "Vibe-coding is not the same as AI-Assisted engineering.\n\nA recent Reddit post described how a FAANG team uses AI and it sparked an important conversation about semantics: \"vibe coding\" and professional \"AI-assisted engineering\". While the post was framed as an example of the former, the process it detailed - complete with technical design documents, stringent code reviews, and test-driven development - is a clear example of the latter imo.\n\nThis distinction is critical because conflating the two risks both devaluing the discipline of engineering and giving newcomers a dangerously incomplete picture of what it takes to build robust, production-ready software.\n\nAs a reminder: \"vibe coding\" is about fully giving in to the creative flow with an AI (high-level prompting), essentially forgetting the code exists. It involves accepting AI suggestions without deep review and focusing on rapid, iterative experimentation, making it ideal for prototypes, MVPs, learning, and what Karpathy calls \"throwaway weekend projects.\" This approach is a powerful way for developers to build intuition and for beginners to flatten the steep learning curve of programming. It prioritizes speed and exploration over the correctness and maintainability required for professional applications.\n\nThere is a spectrum between vibe coding and doing it with a little more planning, spec-driven development, including enough context etc and what is AI-assisted engineering across the software development lifecycle.\n\nIn stark contrast to the post, the process described in the Reddit post is a methodical integration of AI into a mature software development lifecycle. This is \"AI-assisted engineering,\" where AI acts as a powerful collaborator, not a replacement for engineering principles. In this model, developers use AI as a \"force multiplier\" to handle tasks like generating boilerplate code or writing initial test cases, but always within a structured framework. \n\nCrucially, the big difference here is the human engineer remains firmly in control, responsible for the architecture, reviewing and understanding every line of AI-generated code, and ensuring the final product is secure, scalable, and maintainable. The 30% increase in development speed mentioned in the post is a result of augmenting a solid process, not abandoning it.\n\nFor engineers, labeling disciplined, AI-augmented workflows as \"vibe coding\" misrepresents the skill and rigor involved. For those new to the field, it creates the false and risky impression that one can simply prompt their way to a viable product without understanding the underlying code or engineering fundamentals. \n\nIf you're looking to do this right, start with a solid design, subject everything to rigorous human review, and treat AI as an incredibly powerful tool in your engineering toolkit - not as a magic wand that replaces the craft itself.",

You sign in -> Auth server gives you Access Token (15m) + Refresh Token (1h).\n\n2. Your app calls an API with the Access Token.\n\n3. When Access Token expires, your app silently sends the Refresh Token to the /token endpoint of Auth server.\n\n4. AUTH server validates it and issues a new Access Token (and sometimes a new Refresh Token).\n\n5. User stays logged in without retyping credentials.\n\nSecurity concerns:\n\nRefresh Token should never go to the frontend/browser if you can avoid it. Store it safely (server-side or secure storage).\n\nIf a Refresh Token is leaked, attacker can mint new Access Tokens.\n\nUse Refresh Token Rotation -> every time you use it, the Auth Server issues a brand-new one and invalidates the old.\n\nWhen to use them:\n\nMobile apps and SPAs that can\u2019t force the user to log in frequently.\n\nLong-lived sessions (some apps, enterprise dashboards).",

    "note_tweet_text": "Weekend reading for all you ambitious folks. \ud83d\udd25 Learn how to architect a database [Free full-length book on SQL and relational DBMS]\n\nHere are this week's five freeCodeCamp  resources that are worth your time:\n\n1. freeCodeCamp just published this full length book on how to architect a database using SQL and relational database management systems. This book is aimed at beginners, and includes a Jupyter Notebook you can interact with as you follow along. It will teach you Postgres and a bit of SQL. Then you'll learn how to design and maintain efficient, secure databases that support complex data-driven apps. (Full length book): https://t.co/NszcJf1RNQ\n\n2. freeCodeCamp also published this comprehensive data science course on Time Series Forecasting with Python. You'll learn about key Time Series components like trend, seasonality, and residuals. You'll start by building some baseline models. Then you'll dive into Cross-Validation, Exogenous Features, Prediction Interval Generation, and more. (2 hour YouTube course): https://t.co/m6DX0ixzxz\n\n3. On this week's freeCodeCamp podcast, I interview Edidiong Asikpo about her journey from medical school into software engineering. She talks about Nigeria's tech scene, how to break into tech when you live outside the Silicon Valley ecosystem, and how she transitioned from mobile app development to DevOps. Tons of actionable tips here. (1 hour watch or listen in your favorite podcast app): https://t.co/XqVURG98g7\n\n4. freeCodeCamp also published this in-depth guide to passing the Google Cloud Associate Engineer certification exam. Andrew Brown will teach you about Infrastructure as Code, Serverless, Google Kubernetes Engine, data storage solutions, and more. If you're interested in a career in DevOps, take a gander. (11 hour YouTube course): https://t.co/TTsbnAInvW\n\n5. Learn how the popular Next.js web development framework handles caching and rendering. This course uses the latest version of Next.js \u2013 version 15. It will teach you all about Static Site Generation, Server-Side Rendering, Incremental Static Regeneration, and other important concepts. (2 hour YouTube course): https://t.co/LQkOkST2Ds\n\nThese are just some of the open source learning resources that the freeCodeCamp community published this week. Our core curriculum is also under heavy development. We're launching new certifications in the coming months. You can help us accelerate open source education. Start supporting our charity and our mission directly: https://t.co/PJXlqTfhI9\n\nQuote of the Week: \n\u201cTo this day, I remember when my first open source pull request got merged. It was one of the best days of my life. I was so, so happy. I couldn't believe that a code contribution that I made was now part of an application used by thousands of people.\u201d \u2014 Software Engineer @Didicodes on this week's freeCodeCamp podcast\n\nUntil next week, happy coding.",
