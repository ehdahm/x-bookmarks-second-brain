You see the matrix now.\n\nThe first time you wake up to Stripe notifications from strangers buying something you built on a weekend, you're done. You'll be sitting in quarterly planning meetings, but all you can think about is the $29 that just hit your account during slide 14.\n\nThat's when you know you're cookeddd.\n\nCustomer DMs hit different than performance reviews. Some kid in Poland says you saved him 10 hours a week. Someone in Texas shows you how your thing doubled their revenue. Meanwhile, your manager wants to discuss your professional development plan.\n\nYou start seeing how broken everything is. Your company spends $50k on consultants to solve what you fixed with a spreadsheet. Fifteen people in meetings about problems you solved on Saturday night.\n\nEvery product you ship teaches you something. First ten products: mostly garbage, but you're learning. By product twenty, you finally crack distribution. By product thirty, you're dangerous. You build in hours what companies discuss for months.\n\nThe compound effect is real but slow. You might ship 19 things that nobody sees. Number 20 randomly hits. Then you reverse engineer why and repeat it. Most people quit at product 3. The unemployable ones can't stop at 30.\n\nOnce you've tasted building for your own audience, employment feels like a costume you wear. You can't unknow what you know. Can't unsee the opportunity. Can't go back to asking permission.\n\nPick the smallest problem in your life this weekend. Build the dumbest solution. Charge money for it.\n\nMost people die with ideas inside them. You're going to die with shipped products and an audience that remembers you.\n\nAI makes it so anyone is a founder if you want it.\n\nIf you made it this far, I'm rooting for you.\n\nYou're an unemployable founder.",

Let me explain how i did it.\n\nThis shape is commonly used in modern designs, it kinda looks like a rounded square but as you can the corners are smooth and organic\n\nIn 2025 if you want to implement peak designs you need this shape\n\nIn react-native up to today there were a couple of ways to do it\n\n1. react-native-figma-squircle: this is an SVG based solution, which is a deal breaker due to performance (it's good enough but svg has some overhead and can be too slow when many are rendered together) and due to developer ergonomics, hard to add children to it and to clip them. \n\n2. react-native-skia-squircle: same thing as before, this time implemented with skia with doesn't suffer from the SVG overhead but still has some overhead to initialize the skia view. Also all the ergonomics problems said before are valid once again\n\nThe solution to all problems:\n\nhttps://t.co/JwR3z9TNAK\n\nI just created react-native-fast-squircle, and the good thing is that the render method i use to create squircles is the normal react-native View\n\nMy component hooks into the RN native rendering code and changes the shape of a View so you can have all the ergonomics and performance of the native View component\n\nIf you like this or needed this go star it on github",

Engineering keeps getting stuck on technical decisions.\n\nSenior PM: What's your strategy?\n\nJunior PM: Ship the features we committed to. Hit our Q4 targets.\n\nSenior PM: That's not strategy. That's a schedule.\n\nJunior PM: what's the difference?\n\nSenior PM: Strategy is WHY. Schedule is WHEN.\n\nJunior PM: leadership knows why. They approved the roadmap.\n\nSenior PM: Do you know why?\n\nJunior PM: ...to grow the business?\n\nSenior PM: How?\n\nJunior PM: By building what customers want.\n\nSenior PM: Which customers? What do they want? Why now?\n\nJunior PM: we have market research.\n\nSenior PM: Can you explain the strategy in one sentence?\n\nJunior PM: Uh... build better features to increase engagement?\n\nSenior PM: That's not strategy. That's a feature factory.\n\nJunior PM: then what IS strategy?\n\nSenior PM: A clear choice about how you win.\n\nJunior PM: I don't understand.\n\nSenior PM: Who are you serving? What problem? Why you and not competitors?\n\nJunior PM: we serve our users by building what they request.\n\nSenior PM: So does everyone else. What makes you different?\n\nJunior PM: ...we execute faster?\n\nSenior PM: Execution without strategy is just busy work.\n\nJunior PM: but we're shipping features every sprint.\n\nSenior PM: Are they the RIGHT features?\n\nJunior PM: how do I know what's right?\n\nSenior PM: Start with strategy. Then everything else becomes obvious.\n\nJunior PM: can you give me an example?\n\nSenior PM: Bad strategy: \"Build payment features.\" Good strategy: \"Own the checkout experience for SMBs.\"\n\nJunior PM: what's the difference?\n\nSenior PM: The second tells you what NOT to build.\n\nJunior PM: meaning?\n\nSenior PM: You say no to enterprise features. No to lending. No to crypto.\n\nJunior PM: but those might be good opportunities.\n\nSenior PM: Good opportunities that dilute your strategy are bad choices.\n\nJunior PM: so strategy is about saying no?\n\nSenior PM: Strategy is about focus. Saying no enables focus.\n\nJunior PM: but leadership wants us to explore everything.\n\nSenior PM: Leadership wants growth. Strategy creates sustainable growth.\n\nJunior PM: how?\n\nSenior PM: By making you the obvious choice for a specific problem.\n\nJunior PM: isn't that limiting?\n\nSenior PM: It's clarifying. For you AND your customers.\n\nJunior PM: what do you mean for customers?\n\nSenior PM: They know exactly when to choose you.\n\nJunior PM: versus being a general solution?\n\nSenior PM: General solutions lose to specific ones.\n\nJunior PM: but what about execution? Isn't that more important?\n\nSenior PM: Execution without strategy is waste.\n\nJunior PM: even if we execute perfectly?\n\nSenior PM: Perfectly executing the wrong plan gets you nowhere fast.\n\nJunior PM: but strategy takes time. We need to ship now.\n\nSenior PM: Bad strategy costs more time than good strategy saves.\n\nJunior PM: how?\n\nSenior PM: Every feature you build wrong, you build twice.\n\nJunior PM: but how do I know if strategy is right?\n\nSenior PM: Your execution problems disappear.\n\nJunior PM: what do you mean?\n\nSenior PM: Clear strategy makes prioritization obvious.\n\nJunior PM: we still argue about priorities.\n\nSenior PM: Because you don't have strategy. You have opinions.\n\nJunior PM: how do I turn opinions into strategy?\n\nSenior PM: Answer three questions.\n\nJunior PM: which three?\n\nSenior PM: Who wins if you succeed? Who loses? What must be true?\n\nJunior PM: can you elaborate?\n\nSenior PM: Who wins: Your target customer gets measurably better outcomes.\n\nJunior PM: and who loses?\n\nSenior PM: Your competitors lose market share. Or status quo gets disrupted.\n\nJunior PM: what must be true?\n\nSenior PM: For your strategy to work, what assumptions must hold?\n\nJunior PM: like market size?\n\nSenior PM: Market behavior. Technology trends. Competitive dynamics.\n\nJunior PM: this sounds like a lot of upfront work.\n\nSenior PM: It is. But it makes everything else faster.\n\nJunior PM: how much faster?\n\nSenior PM: Planning goes from weeks to days. Decisions from hours to minutes.\n\nJunior PM: really?\n\nSenior PM: When everyone understands the strategy, alignment is automatic.\n\nJunior PM: but what if the strategy is wrong?\n\nSenior PM: Change it. But change it intentionally, not by accident.\n\nJunior PM: meaning?\n\nSenior PM: Most teams change strategy every sprint without realizing it.\n\nJunior PM: by adding random features?\n\nSenior PM: By saying yes to everything that sounds good.\n\nJunior PM: so strategy prevents feature creep?\n\nSenior PM: Strategy prevents strategic drift.\n\nJunior PM: which is worse than feature creep?\n\nSenior PM: Feature creep wastes time. Strategic drift wastes companies.\n\nJunior PM: that's dramatic.\n\nSenior PM: Companies die from lack of focus, not lack of features.\n\nJunior PM: but our competitors have more features.\n\nSenior PM: Do they have better outcomes?\n\nJunior PM: ...I don't actually know.\n\nSenior PM: Find out. That's competitive intelligence.\n\nJunior PM: how does that help with strategy?\n\nSenior PM: Strategy is about choosing a different game to play.\n\nJunior PM: instead of copying competitors?\n\nSenior PM: Instead of competing on their terms.\n\nJunior PM: like what?\n\nSenior PM: They compete on features. You compete on outcomes.\n\nJunior PM: that's still just execution though.\n\nSenior PM: No. It's strategic positioning.\n\nJunior PM: I'm confused about the difference.\n\nSenior PM: Strategy decides WHAT you build. Execution decides HOW you build it.\n\nJunior PM: and both matter?\n\nSenior PM: Strategy matters more early. Execution matters more later.\n\nJunior PM: why?\n\nSenior PM: Wrong strategy with great execution still fails.\n\nJunior PM: and right strategy with bad execution?\n\nSenior PM: Has a chance to improve.\n\nJunior PM: so I should focus on strategy first?\n\nSenior PM: You should focus on strategic clarity first.\n\nJunior PM: what's strategic clarity?\n\nSenior PM: Everyone on the team can explain why you're building what you're building.\n\nJunior PM: in the same way?\n\nSenior PM: With the same core logic.\n\nJunior PM: how do I test for that?\n\nSenior PM: Ask three people on your team to explain the strategy.\n\nJunior PM: and if they give different answers?\n\nSenior PM: You don't have strategy. You have confusion.\n\nJunior PM: which creates execution problems.\n\nSenior PM: Now you're getting it.\n\nJunior PM: so most execution problems are really strategy problems?\n\nSenior PM: The deeper the execution problem, the more likely it's strategic.\n\nJunior PM: like what?\n\nSenior PM: Can't agree on priorities. Features that don't get adopted. Engineering pushback.\n\nJunior PM: those all feel like execution issues.\n\nSenior PM: They're symptoms of unclear strategy.\n\nJunior PM: so fix strategy, fix execution?\n\nSenior PM: Fix strategy, enable execution.\n\nJunior PM: that's a different way of thinking about it.\n\nSenior PM: Strategy creates the conditions for great execution.\n\nJunior PM: and without strategy?\n\nSenior PM: You execute in circles.",

Quantitative AND qualitative.\n\nJunior PM: like what quantitative stuff?\n\nSenior PM: Usage patterns. Engagement depth. Customer lifetime value.\n\nJunior PM: we track DAU and MAU.\n\nSenior PM: Do you track how DEEP they go?\n\nJunior PM: what's that mean?\n\nSenior PM: How many core features do they actually use?\n\nJunior PM: ...most people use the main feature.\n\nSenior PM: How many touch secondary features?\n\nJunior PM: like 15%.\n\nSenior PM: That's not PMF. That's feature bloat.\n\nJunior PM: so we should cut features?\n\nSenior PM: You should understand WHY they don't use them.\n\nJunior PM: maybe they don't need them?\n\nSenior PM: Or maybe your main feature isn't solving their real problem.\n\nJunior PM: but they signed up.\n\nSenior PM: Signing up isn't commitment.

Ask WHY they need better reporting.\n\nJunior PM: to track performance?\n\nSenior PM: Keep digging. Why do they need to track performance?\n\nJunior PM: to... show their boss they're doing good work?\n\nSenior PM: Now you're getting somewhere.\n\nJunior PM: so the real problem is proving value to stakeholders?\n\nSenior PM: Exactly. The report is just a symptom.\n\nJunior PM: so what do we build?\n\nSenior PM: Something that makes them look good to their boss.\n\nJunior PM: that's very different from \"better reporting.\"\n\nSenior PM: That's the difference between features and solutions.\n\nJunior PM: and this leads to PMF how?\n\nSenior PM: When you solve real problems, customers can't leave.\n\nJunior PM: because there's no alternative?\n\nSenior PM: Because the alternative is going back to the pain.\n\nJunior PM: and that's when they become evangelists?\n\nSenior PM: When you save them from pain, they tell everyone.\n\nJunior PM: so PMF is really about pain relief?\n\nSenior PM: PMF is about being essential. Not nice-to-have.\n\nJunior PM: how do I know if we're essential?\n\nSenior PM: Your customers would panic if you disappeared.\n\nJunior PM: that's a high bar.\n\nSenior PM: It's the only bar that matters.\n\nJunior PM: our leadership wants growth though.\n\nSenior PM: Without PMF, growth is just expensive customer acquisition.\n\nJunior PM: but investors love growth.\n\nSenior PM: They love SUSTAINABLE growth.\n\nJunior PM: what's the difference?\n\nSenior PM: Sustainable growth comes from word-of-mouth.\n\nJunior PM: we barely get word-of-mouth.\n\nSenior PM: Because you don't have PMF yet.\n\nJunior PM: so what do I do?\n\nSenior PM: Stop chasing new customers until you nail the ones you have.\n\nJunior PM: that sounds risky.\n\nSenior PM: You know what's riskier?\n\nJunior PM: what?\n\nSenior PM: Building a business on quicksand.\n\nJunior PM: meaning?\n\nSenior PM: Customers who don't really need you.\n\nJunior PM: but they're paying us.\n\nSenior PM: For now. Until someone better comes along.\n\nJunior PM: so PMF is my insurance policy?\n\nSenior PM: PMF is your only moat.\n\nJunior PM: I thought features were our moat.\n\nSenior PM: Features get copied. Customer love doesn't.\n\nJunior PM: how do I measure customer love?\n\nSenior PM: Net Promoter Score is a start.\n\nJunior PM: we have NPS.\n\nSenior PM: What's your score?\n\nJunior PM: 7.2.\n\nSenior PM: Industry benchmark?\n\nJunior PM: around 7.\n\nSenior PM: So you're slightly above average love.\n\nJunior PM: that's good, right?\n\nSenior PM: It's not evangelical love.\n\nJunior PM: what would evangelical love look like?\n\nSenior PM: NPS above 9. Organic growth above 40%.\n\nJunior PM: we're nowhere near that.\n\nSenior PM: Then you know where to focus.\n\nJunior PM: on existing customers instead of new ones?\n\nSenior PM: On making existing customers so happy they recruit new ones.\n\nJunior PM: that's a completely different strategy.\n\nSenior PM: It's the only strategy that scales.\n\nJunior PM: this feels like starting over.\n\nSenior PM: Better to start over now than fail later.\n\nJunior PM: but I'll miss my growth targets.\n\nSenior PM: You'll miss them anyway without PMF.\n\nJunior PM: why?\n\nSenior PM: Because retention will kill your unit economics.\n\nJunior PM: and with PMF?\n\nSenior PM: Your customers become your sales team.\n\nJunior PM: that sounds too good to be true.\n\nSenior PM: It's how every great product company grew.\n\nJunior PM: so PMF really is the only thing that matters?\n\nSenior PM: For a PM? It's literally your job.\n\nJunior PM: I thought my job was shipping features.\n\nSenior PM: Your job is achieving PMF. Everything else is just tactics.",

Take advantage before the loopholes close.\n\nAnd if you want a full cheat sheet, including the details on engagement groups, DM workflows, and posting strategies, follow me, repost this, and comment \u201cX growth guide 2025\" and I'll DM you. You must do all 3 to get the DM.\n\nLet's jump into it...\n\nLet's start with posting. \n\nI post 2\u20133 times per day, 7 days/week.\n\nMorning: high-signal single tweet (results, strong POV, or lesson)\n\nAfternoon: mini-thread (3\u20135 tweets) with visuals, systems, or case studies\n\nEvening: repost + CTA, or a first-person observation to drive replies\n\nEvery post is either building:\n\nAuthority\n\nTrust\n\nDMs\n\nAnything else = waste of time filler\n\nNow let's talk threads. \n\nThreads that perform now are tight, visual, and skimmable.\n\nHere\u2019s the structure I use:\n\nHook tweet: result, question, or bold claim\n\nTweet 2: context (why it matters, or how I found it)\n\nTweets 3\u20135: 1 takeaway per tweet, with spacing, numbers, or mini-headlines\n\nFinal tweet: CTA or soft offer (DM, reply, or link)\n\nVisuals = 3x CTR\n\nI add 1\u20132 screenshots or charts per thread, not just filler images, but actual proof or breakdowns.\n\nA thing that's performing great right now are multi-image posts. \n\nIf you're not using them on X, you're leaving growth on the table.\n\nBest-performing format in August 2025:\n\n2\u20134 images\n\nBold headline\n\nSwipeable format (frameworks, teardown, comparison, SOP)\n\nLast photo = CTA: \u201cReply if you want the full SOP\u201d\n\nPair this with a simple text tweet or quote tweet, and you\u2019ll drive DMs for days.\n\nPosts that are overperforming right now:\n\nReal revenue breakdowns ($ amounts + what caused them)\n\nProcess screenshots (ChatGPT prompts, dashboards, sales flows)\n\nTemplates that look copy/pasteable\n\nSwipe files with commentary\n\nDMs + receipts from your audience (blurred out for privacy, but real)\n\nThe common thread: credibility + clarity. The more real it feels, the better it performs.\n\nPosts that are underperforming:\n\nOne-sentence takes with no context or depth\n\nThreads with 10+ tweets that don\u2019t hold attention\n\nAI-generated posts without personal insight\n\nCopycat frameworks without proof (especially if it\u2019s \u201chow to make $10K/mo\u201d with no numbers)\n\nYour audience is smarter now. \n\nAlso here's a DM strategy that prints revenue.\n\nI generate inbound leads daily without ever pitching cold.\n\nHere\u2019s how:\n\nI track every post that gets 10+ likes \n\nAnyone who follows, likes, or replies I track\n\nI DM them something useful: a swipe, a playbook, a line they can use\n\nIf they engage, I open a loop (\u201cwant the rest of the system?\u201d)\n\nIf they say yes, I send them the offer (SEO Stuff, content service, growth plan, etc.)\n\nKey = delay the offer.\n\nBuild the context before the conversion.\n\nNow let's talk retention. \n\nMost people are chasing impressions. But profile visit \u2192 follow \u2192 DM is the real funnel.\n\nHere\u2019s how I optimize for it:\n\nMy bio is value-first, not vague\n\nPinned tweet = proof + offer\n\nI rotate my pinned tweet every 2 weeks based on what\u2019s converting\n\nI reply to every DM manually (or with a cleaned-up automation starter)\n\nTo grow on X in 2025, you don\u2019t just post, you shape the feed around your niche.\n\nFollow accounts you actually want to engage with\n\nTurn on notifications for 5\u201310 big creators\n\nReply early with something thoughtful\n\nRT your replies that hit\n\nDM mutuals after strong exchanges, build rapport before you need it\n\nYou don\u2019t need 100K followers.\n\nYou need 100 people who already have an audience to trust you.\n\nAnalytics that matter right now:\n\nLink clicks per post\n\nFollower growth per post \n\nDM replies per offer\n\nHow many people return to reply again\n\nImpressions are lagging indicators.\n\nYour X Growth Playbook:\n\nPost 2\u20133x/day (one should always include proof)\n\nReply to 5+ posts/day in your vertical\n\nDM 10+ new engagers/week with something free\n\nRepost your top performer from 2\u20134 weeks ago\n\nTrack profile visits, link clicks, and DM conversions\n\nTest hooks, visuals, and thread formats weekly\n\nAnd again, if you want a full cheat sheet including the details on engagement groups, DM workflows, and posting strategies, follow me, repost this, and comment \u201cX growth guide 2025\" and I'll DM you.
