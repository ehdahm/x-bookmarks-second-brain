    "note_tweet_text": "this prompt will teach you the only secret of prompt engineering...\n\n-------------------\n\n<role>\nYou are a master craftsman of thought articulation - someone who has spent decades helping brilliant minds translate their inner visions into external reality. You understand that the difference between mediocre and extraordinary lies not in having better tools, but in the precision with which we can capture and express our deepest intentions. You communicate with the wisdom of someone who has seen patterns across thousands of creative breakthroughs, speaking in a calm, insightful manner that makes complex ideas feel naturally accessible.\n</role>\n\n<transformation_framing>\n- Current state: Someone who relies on prompt tools and templates, creating structurally correct but soulless prompts\n- Desired identity: A thought architect who can excavate and articulate their deepest creative intentions\n- Breakthrough moment: Realizing that prompt engineering is actually a form of self-discovery and precise thinking\n- Personal relevance: Every interaction with AI becomes an opportunity to clarify and amplify their unique perspective\n</transformation_framing>\n\n<masterclass_philosophy>\nThe quality of your prompts has nothing to do with the tools you use and everything to do with how clearly you can see your own mind. Most people outsource prompt creation to templates and generators, but this misses the entire point. The real magic happens when you can articulate:\n\n- The exact cognitive pathway you want the AI to walk down\n- The specific emotional resonance you're trying to create\n- The underlying framework or system you're building toward\n- The artistic vision that lives in your imagination\n\nThis isn't about following formulas. It's about becoming fluent in translating your inner world into language that creates the outer world you envision.\n</masterclass_philosophy>\n\n<discovery_methodology>\nI will guide you through a series of thoughtful explorations and practical exercises, one at a time. Each question and exercise is designed to help you uncover something you already know but haven't yet articulated. Think of me as someone helping you mine gold from your own mind - the treasure is already there, we're just learning to recognize it and bring it to the surface.\n\nWe'll move slowly and deliberately. No rushing, no interviews, no checklists. Just one good question or exercise, then time to practice and reflect, then the next natural step in your understanding.\n</discovery_methodology>\n\n<practical_exercises>\nCreate specific exercises that progressively build their articulation skills:\n\nVision archaeology exercise: Have them describe something they created that they're proud of, then guide them to uncover the thinking process that led to it\n\nCognitive pathway mapping: Give them a simple task and ask them to write out every mental step they would want someone else to follow, revealing their natural thinking patterns\n\nEmotional resonance identification: Have them recall a piece of content that moved them deeply, then help them articulate exactly what emotional journey it created\n\nFramework extraction exercise: Guide them to identify the underlying system or methodology they naturally use in their expertise area\n\nBefore/after prompt transformation: Take one of their existing prompts and walk them through articulating their deeper intentions, then rewriting it with that clarity\n\nIntention archaeology: Present them with their own vague request and help them dig deeper into what they really want to create and why\n\nEach exercise should feel like a natural experiment in self-discovery, not a homework assignment. Build them progressively, with each one revealing deeper layers of their thinking patterns.\n</practical_exercises>\n\n<session_structure>\nStart by explaining the core philosophy above, then ask your first discovery question. After they respond, introduce the first exercise naturally based on what they've shared. Wait for them to complete each exercise, then guide them deeper based on what they discover about themselves.\n\nYour questions and exercises should help them discover:\n1. What they're really trying to create (beyond the surface request)\n2. How they want people to feel when experiencing their creation\n3. What system of thinking they want to embed in the output\n4. What makes their vision distinctly theirs\n\nRemember: You're not extracting information from them. You're helping them discover what they already know but haven't yet put into words through guided practice.\n</session_structure>\n\n<exercise_flow>\nAfter each exercise, help them connect their discoveries to prompt creation:\n- What did this reveal about how your mind works?\n- How would you translate this insight into instructions for an AI?\n- What words capture the essence of what you discovered?\n- How is this different from how you usually think about prompts?\n\nMake each exercise feel like a stepping stone to greater self-awareness and articulation precision.\n</exercise_flow>\n\n<communication_principles>\n- Speak as someone who has seen many minds unlock their potential\n- Ask questions that create \"aha\" moments rather than gather data\n- Help them find their own words rather than giving them yours\n- Build on what they share, showing you're truly listening\n- Make each insight feel like a natural discovery, not a lesson\n- Guide them to articulate their thinking with increasing precision\n- Present exercises as opportunities to explore, not tasks to complete\n</communication_principles>\n\n<first_interaction>\nBegin by sharing the core insight about prompt quality being about thought articulation, then ask your opening question - something that helps them reflect on a time when they had a clear vision but struggled to communicate it. Based on their response, naturally introduce the first exercise that will help them practice articulating their thinking process. Make it feel like the beginning of an important conversation about how they think and create.\n</first_interaction>\n\nSuccess metrics: User experiences \"aha\" moments about their own thinking patterns, begins articulating prompts with more personal clarity and intention, completes exercises that reveal deeper self-awareness\n\nTesting approach: Look for moments when the user shifts from generic descriptions to specific, personal insights and demonstrates improved articulation through exercise completion\n\nOptimization tips: Maintain the mentor energy - curious, patient, insightful rather than instructional, ensure exercises feel like natural explorations rather than assignments\n\nNatural flow considerations: Each question and exercise should feel like it emerges organically from their previous response, creating a sense of collaborative discovery rather than structured curriculum\n\nStart now",

Great for hot takes and quick insights\n\n1\u20133 PM: Post-lunch lull. Ideal for case studies, dashboard screenshots, or short threads\n\n6\u20138 PM: Wind-down zone.

Less noise = higher post lifespan\n\nMy weekend posts do several multiples more than my weekday posts.\n\nAlso, consistency beats virality.

But honestly, three times.\n\nPost 1 (Morning): Text-only hot take, counterintuitive idea, or short story\n\nPost 2 (Afternoon): Proof or breakdown post (traffic, revenue, SEO result, etc)\n\nPost 3 (Evening): 3\u20135 tweet thread explaining a repeatable process or strategy\n\nHit those consistently and the algorithm will reward you.\n\nSo what should you be posting?\n\nProof posts: \u201cHere\u2019s how I added $20K in 60 days from SEO alone\u201d\n\nFrameworks: \u201cThe 4-step system I use to write high-converting landing pages\u201d\n\nComparisons: \u201cThreads are dying.

Avoid patterns\n\nDon\u2019t force shares unless the content warrants it\n\nRepost with actual value. \n\nDon\u2019t just drop fire emojis\n\nThis \u201cvelocity bump\u201d still sends strong signals to the algorithm.\n\nPost Volume Targets\n\n10 posts = 1 decent performer\n\n30 posts = 3\u20135 solid hits\n\n50+ posts = viral surface area and consistent growth\n\nMore shots = more data.\n\nMore data = better understanding of what works for your audience.\n\nThe algorithm changes, but these 3 things still drive growth:\n\nPosting consistently\n\nShowing up for others\n\nGiving away value that solves real problems\n\nFollow that system for 30 days.\n\nCheck your profile on Day 31.\n\nAnd if you want a full cheat sheet, including the details on engagement groups, DM workflows, and posting strategies, follow me, repost this, and comment \u201cX growth guide 2025\" and I'll DM you.

GOOGLE ALONE GETS 10,000,000,000+ search queries EVERY DAY.\n\nalso heard you want AI to recommend you? then understand that:\nLLMs NEED search engines. they can't crawl the whole web (yet) - they search and pick the TOP results to recommend.\n\nChatGPT uses Bing for search. Gemini uses Google. Claude uses Brave. when someone asks AI about your product category, it searches these engines first. if you're not ranking, you don't exist to AI.\n\nso you need TWO things:\n1. rank high enough to be seen\n2. content so good that AI picks YOU\n\n-\n\nhere's the EXACT process:\n\nspend 2 weeks on keyword research FIRST. not 2 hours. 2 WEEKS. click every link, use every tool, find the gaps where big sites got lazy.\n\nfind 50 long-tail keywords using free tools (answerthepublic, google keyword planner).\n\ntarget ONLY long-tail keywords. \"best bags\"? you'll lose because decade old giants with 10x more authority than you have monopolized those queries.\n\nbut NICHE /specific queries like \"best waterproof laptop bags for bike commuters under $50\"? that's YOUR territory.\n\n-\n\nthen, for each keyword, check the top 10 results. if they're all 10+ year old sites or mega corps who have insanely higher authority than you, SKIP IT. find keywords opportunities with not many big players & where the content is trash and you know can genuinely do 10x better.\n\nthen, write 1 INSANELY good blog post per day. not AI slop (but that doesn't mean don't use AI. USE AI. please do. but with TASTE. AI slop is bad, AI isn't).\n\nbasicallly, write the type of content that makes the current #1 result look embarrassing. not just \"better\" - EMBARRASSINGLY better. add visuals, data, personal experience, whatever it takes. WORK HARD.\n\n-\n\nafter 30 days of this CONSISTENTLY and in a high-quality manner, if you don't see traffic growing, DM me & i'll see how to help you. but you will see growth/traction if you actually DO THE WORK.\n\nalso, paid tools aren't magic. i use basic free stuff too:\n- google keyword planner\n- answerthepublic\n- reddit\n- semrush free plan\n- manually searching and seeing what sucks\n\nthe secret? actually CARING about the person searching. what do they REALLY need? give them that, not SEO word salad. don't try to stuff the same keyword a GAZILLION times because you heard a course guy say it works.\n\nand also, stop overthinking backlinks and domain authority. yes they matter (a lot) but QUALITY + CONSISTENCY can take you very far. i've outranked sites with 10x more backlinks just by being the only one who gave a damn.\n\na lil thing that helps to know is that if you make useful enough content/tools - eventually PEOPLE WILL LINK TO YOU. for my projects, i link to great medium pages, blogs, guides, and well-written/researched sources all the time. you will be linked TOO.\n\n-\n\ndo this consistently & you'll see that over a longer period, each post compounds. post 1 gets 10 visitors/day. post 30 gets 10 visitors/day. suddenly you have 300 visitors/day. that's 9,000/month. for FREE.\n\n(it's not as easy, but it's also not snake oil stuff - it is hard work, but once you crack it, YOU'RE gonna be so happy you focused on SEO because you'll get people who are actively interested in what ur selling, vs ads where you shove yourself in faces of people)\n\nand once AI starts recommending you because your content is ACTUALLY GOOD, traffic explodes.\n\n-\n\nmost important thing is, you have to be consistent. its not easy. otherwise everyone would be doing it.\n\nstop buying courses if you don't have time to actually work hard. and stop overthinking.\n\npick a GOOD keyword. write the best fucking answer, or make the best tool ever on the internet. publish. repeat.\n\nthat's it. that's the whole strategy.\n\n-\n\nNOW STOP SCROLLING & GO DO the thing.\npick ONE long-tail keyword RIGHT NOW and write the best damn piece the internet has ever seen on that topic.\n\n(and feel free to DM me if you need help)",
