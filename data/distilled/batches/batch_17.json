I should be doing strategy, not grunt work.\n\nSenior PM: Who asked you to do all that?\n\nJunior PM: Well... nobody directly asked.\n\nSenior PM: Then why are you doing it?\n\nJunior PM: Because if I don't, nothing gets done.\n\nSenior PM: Ah. You've got a monkey problem.\n\nJunior PM: what's that supposed to mean?\n\nSenior PM: You're collecting everyone else's monkeys.\n\nJunior PM: monkeys?\n\nSenior PM: Every problem has a \"next move.\" The monkey lives on whoever\nhas that next move.\n\nJunior PM: so?\n\nSenior PM: You keep taking the next move from other people.\n\nJunior PM: example?\n\nSenior PM: Engineer says \"this error message is confusing.\" You say \"I'll\nrewrite it.\"\n\nJunior PM: that's helping.\n\nSenior PM: That's taking their monkey. Now you own fixing the error\nmessage.\n\nJunior PM: but they won't do it themselves.\n\nSenior PM: Because you always do it for them.\n\nJunior PM: so I should just let things stay broken?\n\nSenior PM: No. You should give the monkey back.\n\nJunior PM: how?\n\nSenior PM: \"This error message is confusing. What are your ideas for fixing\nit?\"\n\nJunior PM: they'll say they don't know.\n\nSenior PM: \"When can you show me three options?\"\n\nJunior PM: but I can write it faster myself.\n\nSenior PM: And you'll be writing error messages forever.\n\nJunior PM: fair point.\n\nSenior PM: Here's the thing about carrying water.\n\nJunior PM: yeah?\n\nSenior PM: It's not about doing everyone's work. It's about ensuring work\ngets done.\n\nJunior PM: what's the difference?\n\nSenior PM: Ownership.\n\nJunior PM: explain.\n\nSenior PM: When you do the work, you own the problem. When they do the\nwork, they own the solution.\n\nJunior PM: but what if they do it wrong?\n\nSenior PM: Then they learn. And you coach them.\n\nJunior PM: sounds slow.\n\nSenior PM: Slower upfront. Faster long-term.\n\nJunior PM: how do I know when to take the monkey?\n\nSenior PM: Good question. Ask yourself: \"Is this building capability or\ncreating dependency?\"\n\nJunior PM: meaning?\n\nSenior PM: Taking the monkey builds dependency. They'll keep bringing\nyou the same problems.\n\nJunior PM: and giving it back?\n\nSenior PM: Builds capability. They learn to solve similar problems\nthemselves.\n\nJunior PM: but some things are genuinely my job.\n\nSenior PM: Absolutely. The key is knowing which.\n\nJunior PM: examples?\n\nSenior PM: Product decisions. Stakeholder alignment. Strategy. Cross-\nteam coordination.\n\nJunior PM: what about writing copy?\n\nSenior PM: Depends. First time? Maybe you do it to show quality\nstandards.\n\nJunior PM: and after that?\n\nSenior PM: You review their copy. You don't write it for them.\n\nJunior PM: this feels mean.\n\nSenior PM: What feels mean about it?\n\nJunior PM: making them struggle when I could just help.\n\nSenior PM: You ARE helping. You're helping them become better at their\njob.\n\nJunior PM: but they might resent me.\n\nSenior PM: They'll resent you more if you make them helpless.\n\nJunior PM: how so?\n\nSenior PM: Nobody wants to be the person who can't solve their own\nproblems.\n\nJunior PM: true.\n\nSenior PM: Plus, you can't scale if everything depends on you.\n\nJunior PM: scaling meaning?\n\nSenior PM: More products, bigger team, complex problems. You become\nthe bottleneck.\n\nJunior PM: so when should I carry water?\n\nSenior PM: When there's a genuine gap. No clear owner, urgent customer\nimpact, or teaching moment.\n\nJunior PM: teaching moment?\n\nSenior PM: \"Let me show you how I'd approach this, then you handle the\nnext one.\"\n\nJunior PM: but what if I'm wrong about who should own it?\n\nSenior PM: Then you learn too. Ask them: \"Who do you think should handle\nthis?\"\n\nJunior PM: and if they say me?\n\nSenior PM: Ask why. Often they just haven't thought about alternatives.\n\nJunior PM: this is harder than just doing it myself.\n\nSenior PM: Everything worth doing is harder than the alternative.\n\nJunior PM: the AI Prompts collection probably has templates for these\nconversations.\n\nSenior PM: Probably. But the real skill is knowing when to use them.\n\nJunior PM: so carrying water is about judgment?\n\nSenior PM: Carrying water is about building systems that don't need you to\ncarry water.\n\nJunior PM: meta.\n\nSenior PM: The best PMs make themselves dispensable by making\neveryone else more capable.\n\nJunior PM: sounds lonely.\n\nSenior PM: Sounds scalable.",

We move fast here. Made the call in our Monday standup.\n\nSenior PM: You moved fast alright. In the wrong direction.\n\nJunior PM: but isn\u2019t speed what matters?\n\nSenior PM: Speed without direction is just expensive chaos.\n\nJunior PM: so I should slow down?\n\nSenior PM: You should think slow, then move fast.\n\nJunior PM: what\u2019s the difference?\n\nSenior PM: Thinking is cheap. Building is expensive.\n\nJunior PM: I don\u2019t follow.\n\nSenior PM: You can spend 10 minutes or 10 days thinking about a problem. Both cost almost nothing.\n\nJunior PM: true.\n\nSenior PM: But once you start building, every day costs thousands of dollars in engineering time.\n\nJunior PM: so when should I think slow?\n\nSenior PM: If the decision affects what you build, think slow. If it affects how you build it, move fast.\n\nJunior PM: example?\n\nSenior PM: Should we build a chat feature? Think slow. That\u2019s a what decision.\n\nJunior PM: and move fast when?\n\nSenior PM: Should chat messages be blue or green?\n\nMove fast. That\u2019s a how decision.\n\nJunior PM: but my boss wants decisions quickly.\n\nSenior PM: Your boss wants good decisions quickly. There\u2019s a difference.\n\nJunior PM: how do I explain taking more time?\n\nSenior PM: Tell them you\u2019re preventing expensive mistakes, not causing delays.\n\nJunior PM: what if I\u2019m wrong after thinking slow?\n\nSenior PM: You\u2019ll be wrong less often. And when you are wrong, you\u2019ll know why.\n\nJunior PM: but competitors might ship first.\n\nSenior PM: Better to ship the right thing second than the wrong thing first.\n\nJunior PM: how long should I think?\n\nSenior PM: Until you can explain the problem to a stranger in one sentence.\n\nJunior PM: that\u2019s it?\n\nSenior PM: If you can\u2019t explain the problem simply, you don\u2019t understand it well enough to solve it.\n\nJunior PM: what about urgent requests?\n\nSenior PM: Urgent means someone else failed to think slow earlier.\n\nJunior PM: so I should push back?\n\nSenior PM: Ask one question. What happens if we wait one day to decide?\n\nJunior PM: and if nothing bad happens?\n\nSenior PM: Then it\u2019s not actually urgent. Take the time to think.\n\nJunior PM: this feels uncomfortable.\n\nSenior PM: Good. Discomfort means you\u2019re avoiding the trap of fake urgency.\n\nJunior PM: what\u2019s fake urgency?\n\nSenior PM: When people say it\u2019s urgent because they want it, not because users need it.\n\nJunior PM: how do I tell the difference?\n\nSenior PM: If someone can\u2019t explain the cost of waiting, it\u2019s fake urgency.\n\nJunior PM: what about analysis paralysis?\n\nSenior PM: Set a thinking deadline. If you need more data after that, start building and learn.\n\nJunior PM: so think slow has limits?\n\nSenior PM: Yes. If thinking longer won\u2019t change your decision, stop thinking and start moving.\n\nJunior PM: this seems like a balancing act.\n\nSenior PM: It is. But here\u2019s the secret.\n\nJunior PM: what?\n\nSenior PM: Most PMs think too little and move too much. You\u2019re probably safer thinking more.\n\nJunior PM: how will I know when I\u2019ve thought enough?\n\nSenior PM: When you\u2019re excited to build it instead of anxious about whether you should.",
