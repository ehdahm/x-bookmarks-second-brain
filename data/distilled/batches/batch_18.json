Fast and slow pointers are an extension of the array's two pointers method to linked lists. The idea is to iterate through the list with 2 pointers moving at different speeds. The pointers are usually called fast and slow.\n\n2. Reversing a linked list is a building block of many problems. It sounds like a tricky thing to do, but it has a simple solution. The trick is to think one step at a time about what you need to reverse a single node. As an alternative, you can use recursion for an even more elegant solution.\n\nOf course, to use these techniques, you need to have a solid grasp of how linked lists work and the different types of linked lists. Another thing to note is the differences between linked lists and arrays. \n\nWhen it comes to algorithmic problems, the pros and cons typically don't matter. But there are some cases where a linked list is part of the best algorithm, and someone might ask you why you decided to use it. \n\nYou can find a detailed guide about Linked Lists that covers all the topics in the latest @EngPolymathic issue.",

Future service providers will request authentication from the Identity Provider, recognize the existing session, and grant access to the user based on the previously authenticated session.\n\nSSO workflows like the above operate on SSO protocols, which are a set of rules that govern how the IdP and SP communicate and trust each other. Common protocols include Security Assertion Markup Language (SAML), OpenID Connect, and OAuth.\n\n~~\nThanks to our partner CodeRabbit who keeps our content free to the community.\n\nTry free AI code reviews in VS Code: https://t.co/3abfzidO6n",

    "note_tweet_text": "In it\u2019s heyday, Goldman\u2019s special situations group was the navy SEALs of money making. Today\u2019s guest, Alan Waxman, used to run that group before leaving to build Sixth Street, now a $115b behemoth.\n\nSSG heads were sometimes of the more brainy, nerdy variety. Not Waxman. He is a force of nature and energy who apparently would pound around the SSG office, loudly and enthusiastically asking people \u201cwho is going to make us some money today?!\u201d\n\nWhen I asked another SSG alum about Alan, he said his main memory was his remarkable nose for talent. Once, the smartest guy at SSG (which is saying something) was a mere entry level associate, 6 or 7 rungs in the hierarchy below Waxman. But, Waxman immediately recognized the raw talent and was joined to this associate at the hip.\n\nUnder Waxman and his team, SSG produced an insane (so insane I can\u2019t quote it!) percent of Goldman\u2019s bottom line. In creating Sixth Street with his partners and team, he sought to recreate and expand the magic of the SSG days. Here, in his first interview of this type, he shares the entire story.\n\nI found Alan to be a singular force. His team is ridiculously talented, and nobody leaves (they\u2019ve never lost a senior person). They\u2019ve even built a unique pool of capital called Tao that sits atop the rest of the firm\u2026tens of billions that can go anywhere and do anything as a permanent pool of money with no restrictions, other than to earn the highest risk adjusted returns possible. Sounds a lot like SSG.\n\nThis was one of my favorite conversations this year. I hope you enjoy.

Helped me solve max subarray sum and longest substring problems efficiently.\n\n\u2192 Two Pointers\nFor problems involving sorted arrays or linked lists, using two pointers moving at different speeds helped me handle in-place reversal, merging, and cycle detection questions.\n\n\u2192 Fast & Slow Pointers\nVariations of two pointers, where one moves faster to detect cycles (like in linked lists) or find middle elements efficiently.\n\n\u2192 Top K Elements (Heap Pattern)\nFor \u201cfind the Kth largest\u201d or \u201ctop K frequent elements\u201d questions, using a heap made these problems straightforward.\n\n\u2192 Binary Search\nIt\u2019s not just for searching in arrays; I learned to use binary search in the answer space for problems like \u201cminimum capacity to ship packages within D days.\u201d\n\n\u2192 DFS & Backtracking\nThis pattern unlocked solving combinations, permutations, and subset generation problems. I learned to explore all possibilities, then backtrack to explore new branches.\n\n\u2192 BFS for Shortest Path\nUsing BFS helped me find the shortest path in unweighted graphs, like finding the minimum number of operations or word ladder transformations.\n\n\u2192 Dynamic Programming (DP)\nBreaking problems into overlapping subproblems and caching results saved me during \u201cclimbing stairs\u201d and \u201ccoin change\u201d type questions.\n\nLearning these patterns turned LeetCode and interview questions from intimidating to manageable. I stopped memorizing solutions and started recognizing patterns that apply across different problems.\n\nFor practical coding resources to strengthen your skills, check out:\nhttps://t.co/ckM6FjLRAz",
