    "note_tweet_text": "This N8N Cold Email Automation Generated $100K in 60 Days\n\nWhile you were manually researching prospects one by one, this automation was stalking 341 LinkedIn profiles, analyzing behavioral psychology triggers and crafting hyper-personalized emails that made CEOs think you personally knew them.\n\nIt doesn't just send cold emails. It becomes a sales psychopath.\n\nHere's what this N8N beast does:\n- Generates leads\n- Scrapes LinkedIn profiles + recent posts automatically\n- Uses Perplexity to research companies across the entire internet\n- Analyzes pain points with GPT-4 reasoning models\n- Writes 3-email sequences that reference specific achievements\n- Rotates between multiple email accounts for perfect deliverability\n- Sends emails in proper time zones so prospects see them immediately\n- Monitors replies and stops sequences when conversations start\n- Handles unsubscribes with one-click legal compliance\n\nThis isn't Instantly or Mailchimp with fancy templates.\nIt's a weaponized personalization machine built in N8N.\n\nWhile others pay $20K+ for similar systems, you'll own this forever with zero fees.\nJust import the JSON files into your N8N instance and watch it work.\n\nIf you're tired of 2% reply rates and want emails that actually book calls, this changes everything.\n\nComment \"N8N\" + RT + Like\nI'll DM you the download link\n(Must be following)\n\nSkip this and go back to sending \"Hope this email finds you well\" to everyone.",
