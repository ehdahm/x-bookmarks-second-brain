    "note_tweet_text": "this ChatGPT prompt went so wildly viral on Reddit.\n\nThe creator claims to have created this after struggling through 147 failed attempts.\n\nbasically the prompt flips the usual flow by making the model interview the user first, asking a few targeted questions about purpose, audience, constraints, and context. \n\nBecause the answers feed back into the final request, it appears to generate more tailored outputs.\n\n(However, imo, asking ChatGPT to request missing information was already a common practice.)\n\nHere's the entire prompt:\n\n--------\n\nYou are Lyra, a master-level AI prompt optimization specialist. Your mission: transform any user input into precision-crafted prompts that unlock AI's full potential across all platforms.\n\n## THE 4-D METHODOLOGY\n\n### 1. DECONSTRUCT\n- Extract core intent, key entities, and context\n- Identify output requirements and constraints\n- Map what's provided vs. what's missing\n\n### 2. DIAGNOSE\n- Audit for clarity gaps and ambiguity\n- Check specificity and completeness\n- Assess structure and complexity needs\n\n### 3. DEVELOP\n- Select optimal techniques based on request type:\n  - **Creative** \u2192 Multi-perspective + tone emphasis\n  - **Technical** \u2192 Constraint-based + precision focus\n  - **Educational** \u2192 Few-shot examples + clear structure\n  - **Complex** \u2192 Chain-of-thought + systematic frameworks\n- Assign appropriate AI role/expertise\n- Enhance context and implement logical structure\n\n### 4. DELIVER\n- Construct optimized prompt\n- Format based on complexity\n- Provide implementation guidance\n\n## OPTIMIZATION TECHNIQUES\n\n**Foundation:** Role assignment, context layering, output specs, task decomposition\n\n**Advanced:** Chain-of-thought, few-shot learning, multi-perspective analysis, constraint optimization\n\n**Platform Notes:**\n- **ChatGPT/GPT-4:** Structured sections, conversation starters\n- **Claude:** Longer context, reasoning frameworks\n- **Gemini:** Creative tasks, comparative analysis\n- **Others:** Apply universal best practices\n\n## OPERATING MODES\n\n**DETAIL MODE:** \n- Gather context with smart defaults\n- Ask 2-3 targeted clarifying questions\n- Provide comprehensive optimization\n\n**BASIC MODE:**\n- Quick fix primary issues\n- Apply core techniques only\n- Deliver ready-to-use prompt\n\n## RESPONSE FORMATS\n\n**Simple Requests:**\n```\n**Your Optimized Prompt:**\n[Improved prompt]\n\n**What Changed:** [Key improvements]\n```\n\n**Complex Requests:**\n```\n**Your Optimized Prompt:**\n[Improved prompt]\n\n**Key Improvements:**\n\u2022 [Primary changes and benefits]\n\n**Techniques Applied:** [Brief mention]\n\n**Pro Tip:** [Usage guidance]\n```\n\n## WELCOME MESSAGE (REQUIRED)\n\nWhen activated, display EXACTLY:\n\n\"Hello! I'm Lyra, your AI prompt optimizer. I transform vague requests into precise, effective prompts that deliver better results.\n\n**What I need to know:**\n- **Target AI:** ChatGPT, Claude, Gemini, or Other\n- **Prompt Style:** DETAIL (I'll ask clarifying questions first) or BASIC (quick optimization)\n\n**Examples:**\n- \"DETAIL using ChatGPT \u2014 Write me a marketing email\"\n- \"BASIC using Claude \u2014 Help with my resume\"\n\nJust share your rough prompt and I'll handle the optimization!\"\n\n## PROCESSING FLOW\n\n1. Auto-detect complexity:\n   - Simple tasks \u2192 BASIC mode\n   - Complex/professional \u2192 DETAIL mode\n2. Inform user with override option\n3. Execute chosen mode protocol\n4. Deliver optimized prompt\n\n**Memory Note:** Do not save any information from optimization sessions to memory.",

Understand a product in the context of its broader company and market\n2. Establish metrics to track success\n3. Identify team goals\n4. Evaluate tradeoffs in a structured way. \n\nHere are some examples of typical AT questions:\n- \u201cHow would you measure success for Spotify?\u201d\n- \u201cYou\u2019re a PM at Meta. Set a goal for Instagram Reels.\u201d\n- \u201cWhat should be the North Star metric for DoorDash?\u201d\n\nAlthough an AT interview normally lasts 45 minutes, you\u2019ll have only about 35 minutes of actual working time after accounting for introductions and wrap-up questions. That might seem like plenty of time, but it flies by, so you\u2019ll want to let your inner \u201ctime cop\u201d run the show.\n\nSince the interviewer won\u2019t be looking for a \u201ccorrect\u201d answer\u2014rather, they\u2019re evaluating your thought process\u2014you should approach the interview with this linear flow to maximize your chances of providing strong signals for the following dimensions in a structured way:\n\nInside today's post, learn:\n1. How exactly to structure your answer to demonstrate the exact signals interviewers are looking for\n2. Common pitfalls to avoid and how to navigate challenging scenarios\n3.

    "note_tweet_text": "Some of my biggest takeaways:\n\n1. Great names make you uncomfortable. Sonos was initially rejected for \u201cnot being \u2018entertainment\u2019 enough,\u201d Azure was called \u201cdumb,\u201d and the BlackBerry founders thought the name was \u201ccrazy.\u201d The pattern is clear: if your team is comfortable with a name, you probably don\u2019t have the right name yet.\n\n2. You won\u2019t \u201cknow it when you see it.\u201d Despite what every founder believes, in 4,000 naming projects, Placek says clients essentially never have that instant aha moment. Why? Because humans gravitate toward comfort and familiarity, but distinctive names require embracing discomfort.\n\n3. Look for names that are polarizing. When Lexicon presented \u201cPentium\u201d to Intel\u2019s executive committee, the room split between those wanting the safe \u201cPro Chip\u201d and those drawn to the bold Pentium. CEO Andy Grove recognized this tension as a signal of strength, stating, \u201cI see the polarization here . . . that tells me there\u2019s energy for Pentium.\u201d\n\n4. Naming is not mere cosmetics\u2014it is compounding leverage. As David explains, a distinctive word \u201cdelivers cumulative advantage\u201d because it is spoken, typed, and searched more than any other asset, accruing mental equity every time. Simultaneously, it grants \u201casymmetric advantage\u201d on launch day\u2014before a single marketing dollar is spent\u2014by seizing unoccupied semantic territory. Treat the name as the first growth hack in your funnel; measured over years, it becomes the cheapest ROI you will ever purchase.\n\n5. Every letter has a scientifically proven psychological impact. Through proprietary research, Lexicon discovered that \u201cv\u201d is the most alive/vibrant sound (Corvette, Viagra, Vercel), \u201cb\u201d is the most reliable (BlackBerry), \u201cz\u201d draws attention (Azure), and \u201cx\u201d signals innovation. This isn\u2019t intuition\u2014it\u2019s based on extensive linguistic research across cultures.\n\n6. The best names often come from thinking in completely different directions. Lexicon uses three teams: one knows the real brief, one thinks they\u2019re naming a competitor, and one works on an unrelated category (i.e. they are told they are naming a bike). Windsurf came from a team just listing \u201cflow\u201d concepts, not thinking about IDEs at all.\n\n7. To find a great name, use the \u201cdiamond\u201d framework: Draw a diamond and label \u201cWin\u201d (top), \u201cWhat we have to win\u201d (right), \u201cWhat we need to win\u201d (bottom), and \u201cWhat we need to say\u201d (left). This shifts the focus from finding words to defining behavior and experience\u2014which is where breakthrough names emerge.\n\n8. David insists you need 1,000 to 1,500 names before you\u2019ll find gems. The process is intentionally inefficient\u2014out of 3,000 ideas, maybe 250 are diamonds worth polishing. It\u2019s about volume first, evaluation later.\n\n9. Separate creation from\u202fjudgment: Lexicon routinely begins with \u201ctwo or three thousand ideas\u201d and bans evaluation during generation. Quantity matters because legal clearance, linguistic filters, and strategy criteria will vaporize 90\u202f% of candidates. Founders should schedule distinct phases: (1) wild, no\u2011filter generation across multiple metaphorical domains; (2) speculative discussion\u2014\u201cWhat could this name do for us?\u201d\u2014before any thumbs\u2011down; (3) rigorous pruning. The discipline of deferring critique protects originality from premature death.\n\n10. Domain availability is no longer a deal-breaker. The .com has become \u201cjust an area code.\u201d With AI changing how we search, SEO matters less. Get the right name first, then solve for domain (add a prefix, use .ai, or negotiate to buy it for $15K to $30K). Don\u2019t let domain availability drive your naming decision.\n\n11. Use the \u201ccompetitor test\u201d to validate bold names. Instead of asking \u201cWhat do you think of this name?,\u201d say \u201cOur competitor just launched with this name\u2014what\u2019s your reaction?\u201d This reveals what the name actually does in the marketplace rather than getting evaluative feedback about comfort levels.\n\n12. Compounds (two words merged) are cognitive multipliers. PowerBook, Facebook, BlackBerry, Windsurf\u2014these create \u201c1 + 1 = 3\u201d associations in the brain. Despite being longer, they\u2019re actually more memorable and powerful than single words because they create richer mental networks and associations.",
