    "note_tweet_text": "New Course: ACP: Agent Communication Protocol\n\nLearn to build agents that communicate and collaborate across different frameworks using ACP in this short course built with @IBMResearch's BeeAI, and taught by @sandi_besen, AI Research Engineer & Ecosystem Lead at IBM, and @nicholasrenotte, Head of AI Developer Advocacy at IBM.\n\nBuilding a multi-agent system with agents built or used by different teams and organizations can become challenging. You may need to write custom integrations each time a team updates their agent design or changes their choice of agentic orchestration framework.\n\nThe Agent Communication Protocol (ACP) is an open protocol that addresses this challenge by standardizing how agents communicate, using a unified RESTful interface that works across frameworks. In this protocol, you host an agent inside an ACP server, which handles requests from an ACP client and passes them to the appropriate agent. Using a standardized client-server interface allows multiple teams to reuse agents across projects. It also makes it easier to switch between frameworks, replace an agent with a new version, or update a multi-agent system without refactoring the entire system.\n\nIn this course, you\u2019ll learn to connect agents through ACP. You\u2019ll understand the lifecycle of an ACP Agent and how it compares to other protocols, such as MCP (Model Context Protocol) and A2A (Agent-to-Agent). You\u2019ll build ACP-compliant agents and implement both sequential and hierarchical workflows of multiple agents collaborating using ACP.\n\nThrough hands-on exercises, you\u2019ll build:\n- A RAG agent with CrewAI and wrap it inside an ACP server.\n- An ACP Client to make calls to the ACP server you created.\n- A sequential workflow that chains an ACP server, created with Smolagents, to the RAG agent.\n- A hierarchical workflow using a router agent that transforms user queries into tasks, delegated to agents available through ACP servers.\n- An agent that uses MCP to access tools and ACP to communicate with other agents.\n\nYou\u2019ll finish up by importing your ACP agents into the BeeAI platform, an open-source registry for discovering and sharing agents.\n\nACP enables collaboration between agents across teams and organizations. By the end of this course, you\u2019ll be able to build ACP agents and workflows that communicate and collaborate regardless of framework.\n\nPlease sign up here: https://t.co/csyHrswJuB",
