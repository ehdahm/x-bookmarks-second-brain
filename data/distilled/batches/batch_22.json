    "note_tweet_text": "Professional prompt engineer @SanderSchulhoff and his team analyze over 1,500 academic papers covering more than 200 prompting techniques.\n\nHere are what they found are the top 5 most effective prompt techniques (with examples):\n\n1. Few-shot prompting\nInstead of just asking a question and hoping for the best, include 2\u20135 examples of what correct looks like in your prompt. For example, for classifying support tickets:\n\nTicket: \u201cI can\u2019t reset my password.\u201d  \nCategory: Account Access  \n---  \nTicket: \u201cThe app crashes when I upload a file.\u201d  \nCategory: Bug Report  \n---  \nTicket: \u201cI want to upgrade to the Pro plan.\u201d  \nCategory:\n\n2. Decomposition\nInstead of asking for the answer immediately, ask the LLM to first figure out the sub-problems involved in solving this problem. For example:\n\n\u201cWhat are the subproblems?\u201d\n...\n\"Great. Now go solve each of these sub-problems.\"\n\n3. Self-criticism\nAsk GPT to reflect on its answer. This boosts reliability and accuracy\u2014especially in logic-heavy or high-stakes tasks. For example:\n\n\u201cHey, can you go and check your response?\" or\n\u201cCan you offer yourself some criticism?\"\n...\n\"Great criticism! Why don't you go ahead and implement that?\"\n\n4. Add context / additional information\nThe more information you give about the task, the better the model performs. Imagine asking an intern to do something\u2014the more details you give them, the better job they'll be able to do.\n\nDon\u2019t just say:\n\nCraft an answer to this support ticket: \u201cWhy did my payment get declined? This is ridiculous.\u201d\n\nInstead:\n\nYou\u2019re writing a reply to a frustrated customer. They\u2019re on our paid plan, and their payment just failed. Keep the tone empathetic, don\u2019t mention upgrades, and include a link to retry payment. Here\u2019s the customer message:\n\u201cWhy did my payment get declined? This is ridiculous.\u201d\n\n5. Use ensemble prompting\nLLMs can be inconsistent, so don\u2019t rely on a single response. Run 3\u20135 variations of your prompt, then:\n\u2022 Compare answers\n\u2022 Rank or vote on the best one\n\u2022 Optionally re-feed the top choice for refinement\n\nMore tactics here: https://t.co/XbT2rKY52N",

    "note_tweet_text": "Andrej Karpathy explains why human-AI collaboration often fails: we've got the workflow backwards and the bottleneck wrong.\n\nHe points out that when working with AI, there's a clear pattern. The AI generates solutions quickly while humans verify the output. The goal is making this loop as fast as possible to get real work done.\n\nThe first way to speed this up is through better verification tools. GUIs are crucial because they tap into our brain's visual processing power. Reading through walls of text is slow and painful, but visual interfaces create a highway to understanding.\n\nThe second approach is keeping AI constrained. Karpathy warns that people are getting too excited about autonomous agents. An AI that instantly generates 10,000 lines of code isn't helpful when a human still needs hours to verify it's bug-free and secure.\n\nThe fundamental problem is that even instant AI generation becomes useless if humans can't verify fast enough. The human becomes the bottleneck, having to check for bugs, correct implementation, and security issues in massive outputs.\n\nHis solution is simple: constrain AI output to maintain manageable verification loops. Don't let AI run wild with massive changes. Keep it on a leash so humans can actually review and approve the work effectively.",

AI has evolved much faster than formal AI edu has, and they're stuck in prompt engineering paradigms of 6-12 months ago. \n\nInstead I've found myself suggesting 3 activities: \n\n1. For a week, use OpenAI's o3 model as a strategic collaborator. Talk with it about big ideas, use it to make plans, etc. \n\n2. Use @lovable_dev  to vibe code something meaningful. A version of some old game you loved as a kid. A website or app for some side project idea you've had. A feature idea for your existing company. \n\n3. Use @getlindy  or @n8n_io to start building agentic workflows. Don't get caught up on semantics of \"automated workflows\" vs. \"agents\" -- just start to get a sense for how these automated processes are going to change how you work. \n\nI'm confident that anyone who does these three things right now will be ahead of 99.9999999% of people when it comes to using AI.",
