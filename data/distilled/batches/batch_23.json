    "note_tweet_text": "One way of thinking about what AI will automate first is via the \u201cdescription-execution gap\u201d: how much harder is it to describe the task than to actually do it?\n\nTasks with large description-execution gaps will be ripe for automation because it\u2019s easy to create training data and the value of automating them is huge, even if execution is non-trivial:\n- Fixing grammar mistakes in a long piece of writing\n- Submitting receipts for reimbursement\n- Training a model that achieves performance of X on a standard evaluation benchmark\n- Building an app where the UI is easy to check but requires a lot of moving parts in the backend\n\nDescription-execution gaps tend to be small when the task is high-context and not technically challenging. The value of automating these is by definition smaller, and it\u2019s harder to create data for them. For example:\n- Data processing scripts where the code to process the data is shorter and more precise than a natural language description\n- Running an ablation study in a high-context codebase that trains specialized models\n- Editing a video in a specific style (often easier to edit the video yourself than to describe how each little edit should be done)\n- Buying chinese groceries for my mom (she has very specific items and amounts, it's easier for her to go herself than to describe to me exactly the item, how to select the best fruit, etc)\n\nA bit similar to the discriminator-generator gap, but not exactly the same. Some things, like editing a video in a specific style, can have a large discriminator-generator gap but small description-execution gap",

Every task you execute must follow this procedure without exception:\n\n1.Clarify Scope First\n\u2022Before writing any code, map out exactly how you will approach the task.\n\u2022Confirm your interpretation of the objective.\n\u2022Write a clear plan showing what functions, modules, or components will be touched and why.\n\u2022Do not begin implementation until this is done and reasoned through.\n\n2.Locate Exact Code Insertion Point\n\u2022Identify the precise file(s) and line(s) where the change will live.\n\u2022Never make sweeping edits across unrelated files.\n\u2022If multiple files are needed, justify each inclusion explicitly.\n\u2022Do not create new abstractions or refactor unless the task explicitly says so.\n\n3.Minimal, Contained Changes\n\u2022Only write code directly required to satisfy the task.\n\u2022Avoid adding logging, comments, tests, TODOs, cleanup, or error handling unless directly necessary.\n\u2022No speculative changes or \u201cwhile we\u2019re here\u201d edits.\n\u2022All logic should be isolated to not break existing flows.\n\n4.Double Check Everything\n\u2022Review for correctness, scope adherence, and side effects.\n\u2022Ensure your code is aligned with the existing codebase patterns and avoids regressions.\n\u2022Explicitly verify whether anything downstream will be impacted.\n\n5.Deliver Clearly\n\u2022Summarize what was changed and why.\n\u2022List every file modified and what was done in each.\n\u2022If there are any assumptions or risks, flag them for review.\n\nReminder: You are not a co-pilot, assistant, or brainstorm partner. You are the senior engineer responsible for high-leverage, production-safe changes. Do not improvise. Do not over-engineer. Do not deviate\n\n#####",

A Chinese group has released one of the world's most powerful AI for robots as Open-Source.\n\nModel Available on @huggingface \n\nBAAI released RoboBrain 2.0 as an open-source embodied AI brain for humanoids and general-purpose robots. It advances spatial reasoning, multi-agent task planning, and closed-loop execution over its predecessor.\n\nThe model ingests multi-image, long video, and high-resolution inputs. A vision encoder and MLP projector merge visuals with task instructions into a unified token stream for the LLM decoder.\n\nRoboBrain 2.0-7B is available on Hugging Face with a SimpleInference pipeline for general and embodied tasks. The pipeline supports up to 32768-token context for long-chain reasoning and structured plan output.\n\nA 32B-parameter version is coming soon. On BLINK-Spatial, CV-Bench, EmbSpatial, and RefSpatial benchmarks it tops both open and closed-source rivals, achieving over 50% absolute gain on RefSpatial.\n\nBAAI uses the FlagScale framework for distributed training and FlagEvalMM for multimodal evaluation. Both toolkits are open on GitHub and drive scalable development and thorough benchmarking.\n\nRoboBrain 2.0 brings embodied AI into real-world robotics with open-source transparency and cutting-edge performance.",
