    "note_tweet_text": "Good post from @balajis on the \"verification gap\". \n\nYou could see it as there being two modes in creation. Borrowing GAN terminology:\n1) generation and\n2) discrimination.\ne.g. painting - you make a brush stroke (1) and then you look for a while to see if you improved the painting (2). these two stages are interspersed in pretty much all creative work.\n\nSecond point. Discrimination can be computationally very hard.\n- images are by far the easiest. e.g. image generator teams can create giant grids of results to decide if one image is better than the other. thank you to the giant GPU in your brain built for processing images very fast.\n- text is much harder. it is skimmable, but you have to read, it is semantic, discrete and precise so you also have to reason (esp in e.g. code).\n- audio is maybe even harder still imo, because it force a time axis so it's not even skimmable. you're forced to spend serial compute and can't parallelize it at all.\n\nYou could say that in coding LLMs have collapsed (1) to ~instant, but have done very little to address (2). A person still has to stare at the results and discriminate if they are good. This is my major criticism of LLM coding in that they casually spit out *way* too much code per query at arbitrary complexity, pretending there is no stage 2. Getting that much code is bad and scary. Instead, the LLM has to actively work with you to break down problems into little incremental steps, each more easily verifiable. It has to anticipate the computational work of (2) and reduce it as much as possible. It has to really care.\n\nThis leads me to probably the biggest misunderstanding non-coders have about coding. They think that coding is about writing the code (1). It's not. It's about staring at the code (2). Loading it all into your working memory. Pacing back and forth. Thinking through all the edge cases. If you catch me at a random point while I'm \"programming\", I'm probably just staring at the screen and, if interrupted, really mad because it is so computationally strenuous. If we only get much faster 1, but we don't also reduce 2 (which is most of the time!), then clearly the overall speed of coding won't improve (see Amdahl's law).",

You might first ask: wait, why three tools?\n\nThe reality of AI models today (and AI products) is that it's unlikely a single tool will be able to reliably handle everything. At least that's what I've seen, your mileage may vary.\n\nLet's talk through each tool.\n\nCursor (Primary IDE)\n\nI've been using Cursor as my primary IDE for about 4 months. Before that, I spent 6 months flipping between Zed and Neovim (after using VS Code for a long time). Cursor is really good.\n\n(I have a longer video on Cursor/IDEs if you want more details: https://t.co/0QW3UMExgr)\n\nFor me, Cursor brings the familiarity of VS Code with the best AI interface for general programming (reading files, quick edits, tab completion). Sounds silly but the built-in git diff of VS Code is extremely goated and I prefer it over many other things.\n\nI've only started to briefly experiment with background agents, because at about the same time I started trying out Claude Code. Cursor seems to keep getting better on every release, so I'm going to stick with it.\n\nClaude Code (Agentic Loops)\n\nClaude Code is the first CLI agent I've been extensively testing. There are others in the space (including OSS versions) which likely have similar properties, so it's too soon for me to say one is dramatically better than others.\n\nBut more than anything, Claude Code has shown me the power of extremely fast loops with agents. It feels a bit faster than Cursor's agent, but this could also be the UX (it's really well designed). Claude Code has access to a bunch of tools, including web search, and is able to spin up subtasks to do even more work in parallel.\n\nIn practice, I've found it to be extremely good when you can control the entire \"loop\". Write some code, check if it compiles, if not fix it. Then try the tests. If they fail, fix it. Rinse and repeat for linting or other steps. This is where Software 1.0 best practices meet Software 2.0 (AI-era).\n\nHaving deterministic, fast ways to verify correctness in your apps is key for agents. You want tests. And they can't take 10 minutes to run. You want typed languages and even linters (I begrudgingly accept them now). This way the autonomous agents can \"self heal\" and fix their own mistakes.\n\nI sometimes fire off a prompt to Claude Code and see along the way, it fixed 2 or 3 issues from TypeScript / tests. It's worth really internalizing this point and thinking about how it will impact your tooling choices in the future.\n\nClaude Code still feels expensive, but relative to the value and time saved, it's likely worth it for many people (again, your mileage may vary). I want to try out some others: OpenCode, Amp, and a few other ones hitting the market soon.\n\nv0 (Web Agent)\n\nI've been using v0 for the longest since it's built at Vercel. The first version (*cough* a v0) was pretty basic, and the models at the time really weren't that great (1.5 years ago).\n\nBut v0 has gotten dramatically better since then. At some point, probably 6 months ago or so, it crossed a threshold where quality started to become *really good*.\n\nIt wasn't one specific thing, but many small things. The underlying model (a preprocessing / classification step, a regularly updated base model like Claude 4, and a custom trained AutoFix model) helps fix errors other base models would hit generating code, plus it's able to weave in user preference data and general knowledge of web tools like Next.js / React / etc.\n\n(More on the v0 model if you're curious: https://t.co/hvY6dE6oTo)\n\nI started using v0 for prototyping and making nice UIs. Then I expanded to do animations like framer-motion. And now I'm doing full-stack, backend code on the Next.js side (APIs, talking to databases, etc).\n\nStill, I previously would hit a point where I needed to eject v0 and go to Cursor. Which sucked because then my time in v0 was basically done, and the models in Cursor wouldn't be as good at web stuff as v0. But now both of those are fixed.\n\nI can use the v0 model inside of Cursor, and v0 now has two-way git sync. This means that I can push commits locally in Cursor, go back to the v0 UI, and it just automatically pulls in the latest code and keeps on cooking. This is huge because now I can use Cursor and v0 together without it feeling like a duct-tape mess.\n\nBrowser-based Agents\n\nMy exploration here is still in progress. The Claude Code GitHub integration didn't work when I tried it first, and haven't revisited since, so have been really only using it locally.\n\nI have been using OpenAI Codex a bit more on some of my side projects, essentially as yet another agent that can run in the background (in parallel). For example, I've asked it to think critically about the app architecture and suggest alternative approaches. Or ask it to explain how it thinks the code works, and then compare that to reality. Or even just say \"are there any obvious bugs or red flags\". It's like a swarm (hehe) or people working for me.\n\nI'm using Devin at Vercel to merge a ton of small PRs to our docs. Those things that die off in a Slack thread somewhere, or die in a Linear backlog. I just @ mention Devin in the thread, it makes the PR, and then we ship it.\n\nFunny enough, we also built a custom lil' GitHub Action which uses the AI SDK to have an \"AI code reviewer\". This then checks the output and suggests improvements. More agents in the loop. I haven't tried CodeRabbit but similar idea there.\n\n(A bit more on this here, Devin has been one of my favorites: https://t.co/Wx584LtAiy)\n\nMy recommendation to you all is: try out new tools, revisit old workflows. Things have likely gotten much better since you last tried. The state of the art will be redefined again in 6 months, and we'll have to start this over again. Part of being a great engineer is learning to love the process (and learning to learn).",

The agent turns user input into search queries with Gemini, fetches web results via Google Search API, reflects on them to spot missing info, and loops until it crafts a final answer with citations.\n\n\u2699\ufe0f The Core Concepts\n\nAgent starts by generating initial queries with a Gemini model. It calls Google Search API to get web pages. It runs a reflection step to check if results cover the topic. If gaps exist, it refines queries and repeats until confidence is high, then synthesizes a well-cited answer.\n\n\ud83e\uddf0 Deployment Details\n\nIn production, backend serves the optimized frontend build. LangGraph needs Redis for streaming real-time output and Postgres to save assistant states, threads, and task queues. Docker image builds frontend and backend together. Environment keys (Gemini and LangSmith) must be set before running docker-compose.\n\n\ud83d\udd25 The Most concept here is\n\nThe agent\u2019s reflective loop, where it analyzes search outcomes, spots gaps, and refines queries, ensures deeper, more accurate research without manual prompts.",

    "note_tweet_text": "If you're preparing for coding interviews, don't skip the 2-pointers method.\n\nThe key idea is to have 2 pointers (i.e. indexes) going through an array.\n\nBut there are different ways to implement it:\n\n- inward traversal: one pointer starts at the beginning of the data structure and another at its end. Both pointers move toward each other until they cross or meet.\n\n- one-way traversal: both pointers start at the same end and move in the same direction. However, they move at different speeds or under different conditions\n\n- multi-pass traversal: one pointer does the initial work, and a second pointer takes over when certain conditions are met\n\n- parallel traversal: the pointers move through two different arrays according to some condition\n\nI explained all these methods with practical examples in the latest issue of @EngPolymathic",
