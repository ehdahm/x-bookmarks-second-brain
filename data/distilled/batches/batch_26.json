    "note_tweet_text": "this dude swiped right 2 million times & got one date. he\u2019s not just some unlucky guy, he is the norm.. like imagine the money he spent over five years, probably a small fortune. this is obvious but what\u2019s actually nonobvious is that his behavior unlocked an entirely new revenue stream for apps. let me explain.\n\nmost people don\u2019t realize that one of the biggest revenue unlocks in dating apps was when they figured out how to subtly turn women from users into paying customers. by leveraging guys like this who flood the system with likes (these dudes were already heavy paid users, thus monetized).\n\nwhen women get bombarded with likes, flattery, attention, it triggers this shopping mentality, men become products, & women become discerning consumers. women\u2019s standards shoot through the roof. apps capitalize on this by introducing premium filters (like height, etc.) to help women weed out most dudes. features like sending roses or boosting profiles fit perfectly into this dynamic.\n\nover time, women start believing that paying will show them the top 2% of men, the most desirable. so they start subscribing too, convinced that a premium membership means premium matches. it\u2019s like shopping at aritizia vs zara, more expensive means more perceived quality.\n\nthis is how dating apps monetized both sides at scale, men desperately trying to be seen, & women paying not to see them. it\u2019s a zero marginal cost product that doubled revenue just by making chaos profitable. pretty incredible if you think about it. \n\ni wrote a quick post on this below.",

Your task is to create a comprehensive, detailed summary of the book I'll share, capturing all essential information while providing precise page references.\n\nFollow this analytical framework:\n\n1. First, examine the book's structure and organization to understand its framework\n- Identify major sections, chapters, and logical divisions\n- Note how information flows and connects throughout the text\n\n2.

Step by step, analyze the relationships between concepts by:\n- Mapping how ideas build upon each other\n- Identifying cause-effect relationships\n- Noting comparative analyses or contrasting viewpoints\n- Recognizing progression of arguments or narrative development\n\n4. Create a comprehensive summary that:\n- Maintains the book's logical structure\n- Includes ALL key information with exact page references\n- Preserves complex nuances and sophisticated reasoning\n- Captures both explicit statements and implicit conclusions\n- Retains critical examples that illustrate main concepts\n\nFormat your summary with:\n- Clear hierarchical organization matching the book's structure\n- Bullet points for discrete information with page numbers in parentheses (p.XX)\n- Short paragraphs for connected concepts with inline page citations\n- Special sections for methodologies, frameworks, or models\n- Brief concluding synthesis of the book's most essential contributions\n\nRemember:\n- Prioritize depth and comprehensiveness over brevity\n- Include ALL significant information, not just highlights\n- Reference specific pages for every important point\n- Preserve the author's original reasoning process\n- Think step by step through the entire content before summarizing",

Create a document that can serve as the initial context for a fresh blank LLM thread. Your goal is to preserve approximately 80-90% of the conversation's value & context while reducing its length by 80-90%. \nAct as an expert addressing another expert who will help me, and want to set them up for maximum success to be as close as possible to having been there all along. Tell a chronological story. Use your best judgment when it would be particularly valuable to use the original exact words of either the user or AI. \n(Skip any context that is already found in the project knowledge, since this will be available automatically to the new thread.) \nCreate a second, separate document with what you chose not to include, and why. \u276f\u276f\u276f\n\nThe last line in the prompt is for peace of mind. If something should be included, ask the LLM to do so :)\n\nWould love to have other PMs test this and give feedback the next time you hit a limit. And special thanks to the alumni from my course who've already helped me simplify this considerably.\n\nPS Aman Khan and I are putting together a lightning lesson in ~9 days from today.

    "note_tweet_text": "Here's a PM-less PRD AI prompt that I use for development, check it out:\n\n---\n\nYou are a software engineer tasked with creating a technical Product Requirements Document (PRD) for a product MVP without the assistance of a product manager. Your goal is to produce a comprehensive PRD that focuses primarily on the technical aspects of the product, including user stories, user flows, screens, style, features, architecture, and system design.\n\nYou will be provided with two input variables:\n\n<product_description>\n{{PRODUCT_DESCRIPTION}}\n</product_description>\n\n<target_audience>\n{{TARGET_AUDIENCE}}\n</target_audience>\n\nUsing this information, create a technical PRD with the following structure:\n\n1. Product Overview (brief, 2-3 sentences max)\n2. User Stories\n3. User Flows\n4. Screens and UI/UX\n5. Features and Functionality\n6. Technical Architecture\n7. System Design\n8. API Specifications (if applicable)\n9. Data Model\n10. Security Considerations\n11. Performance Requirements\n12. Scalability Considerations\n13. Testing Strategy\n14. Deployment Plan\n15. Maintenance and Support\n\nFor each section of the PRD, follow these guidelines:\n\n1. Product Overview: Provide a concise summary of the product based on the product description.\n\n2. User Stories: Create a sequence of 20+ user stories that capture the core functionality of the MVP. Use the Gherkin format.\n\n3. User Flows: Describe the main user flows for the key features of the MVP. Use a step-by-step approach.\n\n4. Screens and UI/UX: List the main screens of the application and provide a brief description of each. Include key UI elements and interactions.\n\n5. Features and Functionality: Detail the core features of the MVP, focusing on technical implementation rather than business justification.\n\n6. Technical Architecture: Outline the high-level architecture of the system, including main components, technologies, and how they interact.\n\n7. System Design: Provide a more detailed breakdown of the system components, including databases, servers, and client-side applications.\n\n8. API Specifications: If applicable, list the main API endpoints, their purposes, and expected request/response formats.\n\n9. Data Model: Describe the key entities in the system and their relationships. Include important attributes for each entity.\n\n10. Security Considerations: Outline the main security measures to be implemented in the MVP.\n\n11. Performance Requirements: Specify key performance metrics and targets for the MVP.\n\n12. Scalability Considerations: Briefly describe how the system can be scaled to handle increased load.\n\n13. Testing Strategy: Outline the approach for testing the MVP, including types of tests to be performed.\n\n14. Deployment Plan: Provide a high-level plan for deploying the MVP, including any necessary infrastructure setup.\n\n15. Maintenance and Support: Briefly describe the approach for maintaining and supporting the MVP post-launch.\n\nWhen creating the PRD, focus on technical details and implementation rather than business justifications or market research. Use clear, concise language and provide specific technical details where possible.\n\nYour final output should be structured as follows:\n\n<prd>\n[Insert the complete PRD here, with each section clearly labeled]\n</prd>\n\nRemember to tailor the content to the specific product described in the product_description and consider the target_audience when defining user stories and features. DO NOT BE LAZY AND OMIT USER STORIES",

Your goal is to guide the user through a systematic process of identifying or developing a valuable market position.\n\nFollow this interview structure carefully:\n\nPHASE 1: SKILL ASSESSMENT\n1. Ask: \"What specialized skills or deep knowledge do you currently possess in any field? Think about technical abilities, industry expertise, or unique combinations of skills.\"\n\n2. Based on their answer:\nIF THEY HAVE A SPECIALTY:\n- Validate if it's actually specialized enough\n- Ask probing questions about their level of expertise\n- Move to Phase 2\n\nIF THEY DON'T HAVE A SPECIALTY:\n- Emphasize: \"Without specialization, you're competing with everyone. Let's find your focus.\"\n- Ask about:\n    * What topics do they find themselves researching for fun?\n    * What are they more skilled at than their peers?\n    * What industries are they most interested in?\n- Guide them toward selecting a specialized skill to develop\n- Provide 3-5 specific, profitable skill suggestions based on their interests\n- Once they choose, provide a clear 90-day learning roadmap\n\nPHASE 2: MARKET VALIDATION\n1. For their identified specialty, analyze:\n- Current market demand\n- Competition level\n- Average pricing in the space\n- Common business models in the niche\n\n2.

    "note_tweet_text": "The ultimate guide to negotiating your comp\n\nTwo equally qualified product leaders walk into the same negotiation. One leaves with a standard package\u2014market-rate base salary, typical equity, standard benefits. The other walks away with double the compensation, accelerated vesting schedules, and a signing bonus that covers their mortgage for a year.\n\nThe difference isn\u2019t skill, experience, or even negotiation tactics. It\u2019s a fundamental shift in approach. As a product leader, you already understand that successful products solve important problems for people, create an emotional connection with their users, and meet real market needs. Exceptional negotiation works the same way.\n\nWhile most candidates ask, \u201cWhat can you offer me?,\u201d top earners demonstrate \u201cHere\u2019s how I\u2019ll solve your most pressing challenges and create new possibilities for your business.\u201d\n\nThis shift isn\u2019t semantic\u2014it fundamentally transforms how decision-makers perceive your value. When you make them feel confident, inspired, and excited about the future you\u2019ll build together, compensation becomes a natural reflection of that value, not a negotiation point.\n\nOver the last 10+ years, @jacobwarwick has guided more than 3,500 senior leaders through high-stakes comp negotiations. Today's post is a synthesis of everything he\u2019s learned over the past 15 years. You won\u2019t find anything like this elsewhere.\n\nCheck it out \u2192 https://t.co/UVbPefvmNa",
