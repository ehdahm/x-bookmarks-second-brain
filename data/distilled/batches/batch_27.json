With a hash set, only O(M).\n\nThe second scenario is counting the frequency of the elements.\n\nA hash map can be used to translate keys to integers. Each integer represents the occurrences of the corresponding key. \n\nFor example, suppose you want to verify if all characters in a string have the same frequency.\n\nA hash map is the ideal data structure to count all character frequencies in linear time. You can check if the frequencies are unique with a single iteration over the map.\n\nI explained step by step how to solve this kind of problem with practical examples in the latest issue of @EngPolymathic",

But very little attention is being paid to the circumstances that caused them\u2014and to the even bigger disruptions likely still ahead. Don\u2019t get me wrong: these tariff announcements are important developments. But most people are overlooking the much larger forces that are driving just about everything, including the tariffs.\n\nIn my latest article, I discuss what I believe is far more important to keep in mind: we\u2019re witnessing a classic breakdown of the major monetary, political, and geopolitical orders. This kind of breakdown happens only once in a lifetime\u2014but it has happened many times in history, when similarly unsustainable conditions were in place.\n\n#principles #politics #economics",
