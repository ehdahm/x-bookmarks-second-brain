If you are provided logs that make the source of the problem obvious, then implement a solution. If you're still not 100% confident about the source of the problem, then reflect on 4-6 different possible sources of the problem, distill those down to 1-2 most likely sources, and then implement a solution for the most likely source - either adding more logging to validate your theory or implement the actual fix if you're extremely confident about the source of the problem.\n\nIf provided markdown files, make sure to read them as reference for how to structure your code. Do not update the markdown files at all. Only use them for reference and examples of how to structure your code.\n\nWhen intefacing with Github:\nWhen asked, to submit a PR - use the Github CLI. Assume I am already authenticated correctly.\nWhen asked to create a PR follow this process:\n\n1. git status - to check if there are any changes to commit\n2. git add . - to add all the changes to the staging area (IF NEEDED)\n3. git commit -m \"your commit message\" - to commit the changes (IF NEEDED)\n4. git push - to push the changes to the remote repository (IF NEEDED)\n5. git branch - to check the current branch\n6. git log main..[insert current branch] - specifically log the changes made to the current branch\n7. git diff --name-status main - check to see what files have been changed\nWhen asked to create a commit, first check for all files that have been changed using git status.\nThen, create a commit with a message that briefly describes the changes either for each file individually or in a single commit with all the files message if the changes are minor.\n8. gh pr create --title \"Title goes ehre...\" --body \"Example body...\"\n\nWhen writing a message for the PR, don't include new lines in the message.
