Every single company would rather have an air-gapped system with no internet access.\n\nGroundX is an open-source RAG system that you can run on your servers (or any cloud provider, as long as you have access to GPUs) and works without a network.\n\n(If the military wants to do RAG, this is precisely what they will be looking for.)\n\nI installed GroundX on my AWS account and recorded a video to show you how to use it.\n\nThere are two services you can use:\n\n1. Ingest: This service uses a pretrained vision model to ingest and understand your knowledge base.\n\n2. Search: This service combines text and vector search with a fine-tuned re-ranker model to retrieve information from your knowledge base.\n\nA quick note about the Ingest service:\n\n99% of people think they need better \"retrieval\" mechanisms. I think they need better \"ingestion.\" That's where this service comes in!\n\nIngest \"understands\" your documents in a way I haven't seen before. After you try it, you'll realize why showing your LLM your raw documents is a bad idea.\n\nIn the video, I use a free tool called X-Ray to test a document and understand how the Ingest service breaks it down. You can access this tool by signing up for a free GroundX cloud account and uploading your documents.\n\nYou'll see a bit more about this in the video.",

    "note_tweet_text": "Gmail creator Paul Buchheit on how to build something 100 people love\n\nAs Paul, explains, he built the first version of Gmail in a day. Then he iterated his way to 100 people who loved the product:\n\n\u201cThe whole thing was just iterating, step-by-step trying to build something that made people happy.\u201d\n\nThe team decided that they needed to have 100 happy users before launching Gmail to the world. To achieve this, Paul embedded a quick questionnaire in the interface that asked users:\n\n\u201cAre you happy? Yes or No\u201d\n\nPaul would then seek out all of the \u201cNo\u201d responders and ask them directly: \u201cWhat will it take to make you a happy user?\u201d\n\nHe ignored feedback from the people who said things like \u201cit basically needs to be a clone of Outlook\u201d because they were very unlikely to become happy users.\n\nBut other people just needed a minor feature or a bug fix. So Paul just worked on these easier requests to convert people to happy users one-by-one.\n\nEmail was 30 years old when Paul started building gmail, and it\u2019s pretty much impossible to enter a space like that and build something that appeals to everyone. If you try, what you will end up building is a mediocre product that nobody really loves.\n\nWhat Paul recommends doing instead\u2014and what he did with gmail\u2014is:\n\n\u201cBuild a thing that has really deep appeal. Even if it\u2019s to just a tiny fraction of people\u2014if you can make that small fraction of people obsessively love what you\u2019re building, it\u2019s easier to just grow that group. There\u2019s always people at the margin where if you make the thing slightly better, they\u2019re going to join into that group. It\u2019s easier to start with deep, narrow appeal and broaden it over time than it is to start with broad \u2018meh\u2019 and convert \u2018meh\u2019 to loving your thing en masse.\u201d\n\nVideo source: @ycombinator (2018)",
