Other spaces and locations help quiet our inner noise.\n\nSpend the money & time to get a home that creates quietness & holistic comfort. It is worth it.\n\n2/\nIf you feel good when you criticize someone, you might enjoy the short term self righteousness and validation you get, but if it becomes a habit, you will likely never find joy in the life you have created.\n\n3/\nDon\u2019t look up to anyone.\n\n4/\nConstantly upgrading your social circle (in terms of their success, wealth, fame, connections, etc.) might feel good in the short term, but just leads to long term emptiness.\n\n5/\nContrary to popular wisdom, you are not the average of your 5 closest friends.\n\nBut you can be the average of the 5 books you spend the most time with.\n\nIf you want to be \u201csuccessful\u201d, constantly trying to upgrade the former costs you your soul, while doing the latter costs you less than $200 and some time.\n\n6/\nIf it is important, don\u2019t read with the intent to consume or to repeat or to feel smart. Read with the intent to discover yourself.\n\n7/\nMost of what we experience and assume as imposter syndrome is not real imposter syndrome.\n\nEveryone experiences fear and self-doubt.\n\nThat is not imposter syndrome. It just means you care enough to do a good job and are self-aware enough to know where you need to grow.\n\n8/\nIf something within you is constantly gnawing at you, constantly telling you that you are an imposter who will be found out, pay attention to it because you probably are.\n\nReal imposter syndrome arises when you aren\u2019t self-aware and your outward confidence far exceeds your inner competence.\n\n9/\nAchieving your \u201cfull potential\u201d based on society\u2019s definition of success sounds like a great idea but is actually not a great idea.\n\nTo truly create the best conditions for long-term joy & happiness, you should aim to be just slightly less successful than you actually could be.\n\nThis delta creates room for things that are more important & lasting than achieving your full potential. \n\n10/\nWhen you really think about it real hard, it is quite stupid to feel proud of something you were born with and had no choice in the matter.\n\n11/\nWe are born with more things than our ego would like us to admit.\n\n12/\nWhen a politician or a prominent leader tells you that you should feel proud of something (and it turns out that you were born with it), you are being manipulated. They really want you to feel this pride because it serves their agenda. And they will stop at no lengths.\n\n13/\nThe vast majority of parents manipulate their children constantly & that manipulation continues well beyond the toddler years, for at least the first couple of decades of the child\u2019s life. \n\nIf you think you never do this or no longer do it, you are likely not thinking hard enough.\n\n14/\nIf it doesn\u2019t resonate, either ask or ignore, don\u2019t argue.\n\n15/\nIf you are old-enough and still blame your parents for who you are, be sure to also blame your grandparents for who your parents were, and your great grandparents for who your grandparents were, and ... ... ...\n\nYou get the picture.\n\n16/\nThere is a big difference between expensive and costly.\n\n17/\nWhen you laugh at previous generations for their ignorance or brutality, you might as well laugh at yourself while you are at it. On behalf of future generations.\n\n18/\nIf you are already happy, the most foolish thing you can do is to put all your energy towards becoming happier.\n\n19/\nPast a certain point & beyond temporary bumps, a person\u2019s baseline happiness level dictates whether they are happy, much more than their external situation.  \n\nTherefore, the most important type of self-improvement is whatever helps raise the baseline happiness level you are capable of.\n\n20/\nThe only 2 questions you need for endless self-discovery:\n\ni) Why does this emotion exist?\n\nii) What is causing this thought?\n\n~",

AI is not supposed to be 200B weights of stress and pain. It used to be a place of coffee-infused eureka moments, of exciting late-night arxiv safaris, of wicked smart ideas that put smile on our faces. But all the incoming capital and attention seem to be forcing everyone to race to the bottom.\n\nJensen always tells us not to use phrases like \"beat this, crush that\". I absolutely love this perspective. We are here to lift up an entire ecosystem, not to send anyone to oblivion. I like to think of my work as expanding the pie. We need to bake the pie first, together, the bigger the better, before dividing it. It gives me comfort knowing that our team's works moved the needle for robotics, even just by a tiny bit. \n\nAI is not a zero sum game. In fact, it is perhaps the most positive-sum game that humanity ever plays. And we as a community should act this way. Take care of each other. Send love to \"competitors\" - because in the grand schemes of things, we are all coauthors of an accelerated future.\n\nI never had the privilege to know Felix irl, but I loved his research taste and set up Google Scholar alert for every one of his new papers. His works in agents and VLMs had a big influence on mine. He would've been a great friend. I want to get to know him, but I couldn't any more.\n\nRIP Felix.

Demo time \ud83e\udd73\n(next 10x productivity bump is here?)\n\nSuppose you must refactor a large codebase, e.g.:\n\n> \"use I32 instead of U32 as the native number type\"\n\nThat task, by itself, is simple enough to be automated by Sonnet alone, right? Problem is: what if the codebase is too large to fit on the AI's context, and RAG solutions / editors like Cursor can't precisely isolate which parts require edit (because it needs some semantic reasoning)? What now? Do we fallback to human coding, as did the old Mayans?\n\nOf course not! We just split the codebase in chunks, and send each chunk to ~500 DeepSeek instances in parallel (!). Each instance then decides if given block should be edited or not. This is viable because DeepSeek is smart, fast and really cheap. Finally, we send the blocks that need edit to Sonnet, in a single prompt, and let it work normally. The entire process takes less than a minute, is cheap enough, and very effective. We conclude with a 'git diff' for manual review.\n\nIn short, AI has came to grep search & replace.
