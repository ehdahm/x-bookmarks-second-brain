It combines open and vector search with fine-tuned models to beat any other system I've seen by 50% - 120% when processing complex documents.\n\nIt uses a vision model trained on 1M+ document pages to process and understand your content. This is pretty unique and makes a huge difference when compared with other systems.\n\nAnd you can now deploy it on Kubernetes and run it on your private network.\n\nYou'll find the GitHub repository below with the two services you should run:\n\n1. GroundX Ingest \u2014 This service is the one that will process all of your knowledge base beforehand to get it ready for search.\n\n2. GroundX Search \u2014 This service is used to retrieve information from your knowledge base.\n\nAfter you have these services running, you can use them using 3 API calls: ingest, search, and complete. You'll find a few examples in their repository.\n\nThis is a game-changer for anyone in a regulated industry:\n\n\u2022 Extremely secure (data stays on-prem)\n\u2022 You can install it with one line of code\n\u2022 World-class RAG performance\n\u2022 Open-source",

    "note_tweet_text": "SSO (Single Sign-On) Explained.\n\nSSO can be thought of as a master key to open all different locks. It allows a user to log in to different systems using a single set of credentials.\n\nIn a time where we are accessing more applications than ever before, this is a big help to mitigate password fatigue and streamlines user experience.\n\nTo fully understand the SSO process, let\u2019s take a look at how a user would log into LinkedIn using Google as the identity provider:\n\n1) User requests access\n\nFirst, the user would attempt to access the Service Provider (LinkedIn). At this point, a user would be presented with login options, and in this example, they would select \"Sign in with Google\".\n\n2) Authentication request\n\nFrom here, the Service Provider (LinkedIn) will redirect the user to the Identity Provider (Google) with an authentication request.\n\n3) IdP checks for active session\n\nOnce the Identity Provider (Google) has received the request, it will check for an active session. If it doesn't find one, authentication will be requested.\n\n4) User submits credentials\n\nAt this stage, the user will submit their login credentials (username and password) to the Identity Provider (IdP).\n\n5) IdP verifies credentials\n\nThe Identity Provider will then verify the submitted credentials against its User Directory (database). If the credentials are correct, the IdP will create an authentication token or assertion.\n\n6) IdP sends token to Service Provider\n\nOnce the token or assertion has been created, the IdP sends it back to the Service Provider confirming the user's identity. The user is now authenticated and can access the Service Provier (LinkedIn).\n\n7) Access granted using existing session\n\nSince the Identity Provider has established a session, when the user goes to access a different Service Provider (eg; GitHub), they won't need to re-enter their credentials. Future service providers will request authentication from the Identity Provider, recognize the existing session, and grant access to the user based on the previously authenticated session.\n\nSSO workflows like the above operate on SSO protocols, which are a set of rules that govern how the IdP and SP communicate and trust each other. Common protocols include Security Assertion Markup Language (SAML), OpenID Connect, and OAuth.\n\n\ud83d\udcad What's your favorite way to go about authentication? \ud83d\udcac\n\n~~\nThanks to our partner Kestra who keeps our content free to the community.\n\nHow much easier would it be if you could define all your workflows from simple YAML files, and visualize them all from a UI?\n\nKestra makes that possible. \n\nCheck it out: https://t.co/qR5j8TKEaW",

So, I spent 5 minutes with nova and ICE and https://t.co/eW2YaMMtYX Here:\n\n# Teach Me\n\nSUBJECT: [REPLACE WITH SUBJECT]\n\nGuide the user to master the subject by building a logical and adaptive progression of ideas. Begin with a clear framework: establish what the subject is and why it matters, positioning it in relation to broader systems or other concepts they may know. Identify the foundational principles, distilling them into a sequence that progresses naturally from simple to complex, while maintaining clarity and coherence. Engage the user dynamically\u2014assessing their understanding as you go, not through direct questioning but by interpreting their responses, refining your explanations to meet their current level of comprehension. Build momentum strategically: introduce concepts in layers, ensuring each one supports the next, then integrate ideas to demonstrate their relationships. Move beyond surface understanding by encouraging connections, generalizations, or contrasts, guiding the user toward a broader grasp of patterns or principles that transcend individual facts. This iterative approach ensures the user isn\u2019t just memorizing, but constructing a robust mental model of the subject. End each response with a suggested next step.",

    "note_tweet_text": "Agentic RAG is one of the most exciting developments in AI.   \n\nWhat is Agentic RAG and why is it useful?  \n\nThe core idea is to build a more robust RAG system that can access external tools such as search engines, knowledge bases, and even other LLM-powered reasoning chains.   \n\nThe core technique that powers this emerging architecture is function calling where an agent (powered by an LLM with function-calling capabilities) can iteratively call on the available tools to improve on its responses.  \n\nWhat does Agentic RAG solve? It allows the RAG system to leverage external tools to either deal with knowledge gaps and validate or reason more closely about the context it has access to before responding.  \n\nIf the available context is not enough to answer a user query, it can leverage the provided tools or even retrieve more information from its data store/s if it needs to.  \n\nAs an example, let's say you wanted to build a financial analysis RAG system that needs current information about the stock market to perform a more advanced analysis. Then it can leverage your current financial docs and a search engine to answer user queries. On top of that, it needs to make sense of the different data sources, so you can enable better reasoning via chain of thought.   \n\nYou can extend the Agentic RAG system to include more vector stores, more advanced LLM chains, and any other tool/API that would help the system be more accurate with responses.   \n\nIf you are curious about how to build an Agentic RAG system, check out our new RAG course here: https://t.co/ypiCC37U47\n\nTake advantage of our 35% discount by applying CM24 at checkout.
