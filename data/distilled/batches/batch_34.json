    "note_tweet_text": "\ud83d\udc40 Feature-Based React Architecture\n\nIn a growing application, it's easy for different domains to become intertwined.\n\nFor example, in the UI, a Comment component can quickly end up inside a Post component, and a data-fetching function might be extended beyond its original purpose.\n\nThis often happens in larger projects, where you'll encounter descriptive data-fetching functions like getPostWithAuthor() or getPostWithComments().\n\nHere, I'll demonstrate how I typically decouple domains in React using a feature-based architecture:\n\n1\u20e3 Identify cases where domains are intertwined in your UI or business logic.\n\n2\u20e3 Break down large, multi-purpose query functions into smaller, domain-focused query functions.\n\n3\u20e3 Separate components from different domains by placing them in their dedicated feature folders. Let each component handle its own data fetching.\n\nAt this point, you encounter waterfall requests ...\n\n4\u20e3 Lift components and their data fetching higher up the hierarchy to avoid nesting components. This nesting often occurs when database relationships are projected directly onto the UI.\n\n5\u20e3 Shift from parallel to sequential data fetching to improve the performance.\n\nAnd that's it! You've successfully decoupled your domains across different layers of your application (e.g., UI layer, API layer) while maintaining better structure and ensuring performance isn't compromised.\n\nWe are learning this approach in The Road to Next \ud83d\udd25 Closing in 24 hours.",

Search Anything in the DevTools\n\n\u2022Use Ctrl+Shift+P (Cmd+Shift+P on Mac) to bring up the command menu. This works as a search bar for any feature in DevTools. For example:\n\u2022Type \u201cscreenshot\u201d to capture screenshots directly.\n\u2022Type \u201cshow rulers\u201d to toggle rulers.\n\n2. CSS Debugging with Forced States\n\n\u2022Right-click an element \u2192 Force State \u2192 Apply :hover, :focus, or :active to simulate states without needing to interact with the UI.\n\n3. $$ Shortcut for DOM Queries\n\n\u2022In the Console:\n\u2022$$('selector') works like document.querySelectorAll to quickly grab elements.\n\u2022$0 accesses the last-selected element in the Elements panel.\n\u2022$1, $2, etc., access previously selected elements.\n\n4. Log DOM Changes\n\n\u2022Right-click an element \u2192 Break on\u2026 \u2192 Select \u201cSubtree Modifications\u201d to pause execution whenever the DOM changes for that element.\n\n5. Copy as JavaScript Snippet\n\n\u2022Right-click a DOM element \u2192 Copy \u2192 Copy JS path to copy the document.querySelector code for that element.\n\n6. Color Picker and Eyedropper\n\n\u2022Inspect an element \u2192 Click on its color property to open the color picker.\n\u2022Use the eyedropper tool to sample any color on your screen.\n\n7. Monitor Events\n\n\u2022In the Console, use monitorEvents(element, 'eventType') to log when a specific event occurs, e.g.:\n\nmonitorEvents(document.body, 'click');\n\n8. Performance Insights with Lighthouse\n\n\u2022Use the Lighthouse tab for generating performance audits and insights directly within the DevTools.\n\n9. CSS Grid and Flexbox Overlays\n\n\u2022In the Elements tab, look for grid and flexbox containers. Click the icon next to them to toggle overlays, making debugging layouts much easier.\n\n10. Track Layout Changes with Paint Flashing\n\n\u2022In the Rendering tab (accessible via Ctrl+Shift+P \u2192 \u201cShow Rendering\u201d), enable Paint Flashing to visualize which areas of the screen are being repainted.\n\n11. Emulate Slow Networks or CPUs\n\n\u2022Go to the Performance tab \u2192 Click the Settings \u2192 Adjust network throttling or CPU throttling to test under constrained conditions.\n\n12. Instant JavaScript Execution\n\n\u2022Select text in the Console or in the Sources panel, right-click, and choose Evaluate in Console to run it directly.\n\n13. Copy Network Requests as fetch\n\n\u2022Open the Network tab, right-click any request \u2192 Copy \u2192 Copy as fetch to get a ready-to-use JavaScript snippet.\n\n14. Block Specific URLs\n\n\u2022In the Network tab, right-click a request \u2192 Block request URL to simulate missing or blocked resources.\n\n15. Replay User Flows\n\n\u2022In Chrome\u2019s Recorder panel, you can record a series of interactions, save them, and replay for debugging flows like logins or checkout.\n\n16. Console Table Display\n\n\u2022Use console.table() to display arrays or objects as neat, sortable tables:\n\nconsole.table([{name: 'Alice', age: 30}, {name: 'Bob', age: 25}]);\n\n17. CSS Animations Playback\n\n\u2022In the Animations tab, you can scrub through animations frame-by-frame or adjust playback speed.\n\n18. Inspect HTTP Headers\n\n\u2022In the Network tab, click on any request, then go to the Headers tab to view request and response headers.\n\n19. Debug Async Call Stacks\n\n\u2022Open the Call Stack panel and enable Async mode to trace asynchronous JavaScript calls more easily.\n\n20. Record Screenshots for UI/Animation Debugging\n\n\u2022In the Performance tab, click the camera icon before starting a recording to capture a frame-by-frame breakdown.",

    "note_tweet_text": "Tokenization explained.\n\nTokenization is a security technique that replaces sensitive information with unique placeholder values called tokens.\n\nBy tokenizing your sensitive data, you can protect them from unauthorized access and lessen the impact of data breaches. Tokenization also lets you scale back on security measures in other areas of the system.\n\nTokenization process:\n\nSensitive data is sent to a tokenization service when it enters the system. There, a unique token is generated, and both the sensitive data and the token are kept in a secure database known as a token vault.\n\nFor extra protection, the sensitive data is generally encrypted within the secure data storage. The token is then used in place of the sensitive data within the system and third-party integrations.\n\nDetokenization process:\n\nWhen an authorized service requires sensitive data, it sends a request to the tokenization service that contains the token. The tokenization service validates that the requester has all the required permissions. If it does, it uses the token to get the sensitive data from the token vault and returns it to the authorized service.\n\nTokenization is useful for more than just protecting sensitive data. It also helps simplify the rest of the system, because you don't need to worry about additional security measures in components that handle a token instead of sensitive data.\n\n~~\nThank you to our partner Kickresume who keeps our content free to the community.\n\nThink your resume could be better?
