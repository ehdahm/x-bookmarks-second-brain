    "note_tweet_text": "Free AI coding Masterclass: (for beginners)\n\nI spent 217 hours on Cursor, v0 and Claude in last 48 days. \n\nI knew nothing about Nextjs App router structure.\n\nBut now I am coding 1 web app in 4-7 days. (frontend, backend, sign in, landing page)\n\nHere's all my findings:\n\n1. Documentation is key! Spend 80% of your time with GPT4o1 model. \n\nYou need to create document for everything. \n- Project Requirements Doc (PRD)\n- Each Page layout and structure\n- App flow doc\n- App functionality doc\n\nOnce you have the docs. Save them in .md format and go to Claude!\n\nYes Claude.\n\n2. Claude will be your main brain. (Claude 3.5 sonnet available on cursor is dumb, I doubt it is 3.5 sonnet)\n\nSo create a PROJECT on Claude and upload all docs you've created with o1 model.\n\n3. Now go to v0 by vercel. (v0 will be your best frontend designer)\n\nStart a new PROJECT on v0.\n\nTake each page doc like (dashboard page, app flow and functionality docs) and paste it there.\n\nNow v0 will have the context about the project, tech stack, flow and what this app will do.\n\nNow start building frontend components. \n\nMake sure you break down each page into multiple components like\n- header\n- metrics\n- form\nEtc\n\nThis will help you refine the code with v0 without breaking.\n\nBecause you have all docs ready, it'll save you alot of time on v0 and v0 components will be designed quickly.\n\n(v0 starts breaking up after v10 of any component, so fork it before v10 and continue the editing)\n\nOnce you have al the components ready from v0.\n\n4. Go back to Claude and paste each page code in Claude Project.\n\nThis will give Claude the context of the code + the requirements of the project. \n\nIt will help you when you work on cursor.\n\n5. Now go to replit. (Replit will help you connect Cursor + Github + Localhost)\n\nGo to Replit, start new Nextjs Repl.\n\n(I personally use Supabase + Nextjs Starter kit boilerplate from Supabase) it's good.\n\nConnect Github\n\nConnect cursor with SSH connection.\n\n6. Now go to cursor. Create all folders and files Claude ask you to create.\n\nRun project on Replit.\n\nPaste the code in specific folders.\n\nInstall all dependencies.\n\nNow you have the frontend code steup.\n\n7. Create backend. I use Supabase to create the database, storage and even auth too.\n\nAI can code you the Database tables, that's the best part.\n\nSo go to Supabase, start new project.\n\nGet your keys and paste in env.local file in cursor.\n\nNow you have connected supabase.\n\n8. Ask AI to help you create backend (database tables, storage buckets, auth tables)\n\nFollow the instructions Claude is giving you.\n\nOnce you're done. Now you'll have a proper Web app with frontend, backend and sign in sign up functionality. \n\n9. This is debugging and refinement time. \n\nTest all features on all pages and use claude + cursor composer to get the debugging work done.\n\n10. Design the landing page.\n\nO1 for content and lauout\nV0 for code.\nCursor for assembling code.\nReplit to deploy your landing page.\n\nNow you have a Modern Web app with Modern Landing page.\n\nIt looks complicated right? But it's not.\n\nIt's never been as easy to hard code software before. \n\n50 days back i didn't know;\n- Next js App router \n- database tables\n- auth functions\n- shadcn Radix\n- SSH connection\n\nAI helped me learn coding. Now I can code a proper web app in max 7 days.\n\nCoded 7 projects in last 30 days.\n\nNow my plan is to, not share the business plans but build businesses with AI code.\n\nAnd sell the projects on Acquire .com or to clients (as I'm doing right now)\n\nAnd repeat.\n\nI love to build, so I'll continue that.\n\nSend me a DM if you need any specific help. \n\nShare the tweet to break me free from Algo bans.\n\nThanks.\n\n- CJ",
