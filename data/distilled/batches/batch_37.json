The first option is the best, yet it is often impossible to do. So, we have books written by people who are probably the best at this in the world at the time of writing. \n\nIf we look at the software engineering world, there are many gems, but I will recommend the best books per area of work.

This pattern provides a flexible alternative to subclassing for extending functionality.\n\n\ud835\udde3\ud835\uddff\ud835\uddfc\ud835\ude05\ud835\ude06: The Proxy pattern provides a surrogate or placeholder for another object to control access to it. In its most general form, a proxy is a class functioning as an interface to something else.\n\n\ud835\udfef. \ud835\uddd5\ud835\uddf2\ud835\uddf5\ud835\uddee\ud835\ude03\ud835\uddf6\ud835\uddfc\ud835\uddff\ud835\uddee\ud835\uddf9 \ud835\udde3\ud835\uddee\ud835\ude01\ud835\ude01\ud835\uddf2\ud835\uddff\ud835\uddfb\ud835\ude00\n\nThese patterns are specifically concerned with communication between objects and how they interact and distribute work.\n\nImportant patterns in this group are:\n\n\ud835\uddd6\ud835\uddfc\ud835\uddfa\ud835\uddfa\ud835\uddee\ud835\uddfb\ud835\uddf1: The Command pattern encapsulates a request as an object, thus allowing users to parameterize clients with queues, requests, and operations.\n\n\ud835\udde7\ud835\uddf2\ud835\uddfa\ud835\uddfd\ud835\uddf9\ud835\uddee\ud835\ude01\ud835\uddf2 \ud835\udde0\ud835\uddf2\ud835\ude01\ud835\uddf5\ud835\uddfc\ud835\uddf1: This pattern defines the program skeleton of an algorithm in a method called template method, which defers some steps to subclasses.\n\n\ud835\udde6\ud835\ude01\ud835\uddff\ud835\uddee\ud835\ude01\ud835\uddf2\ud835\uddf4\ud835\ude06: The Strategy pattern defines a family of algorithms, encapsulates each one, and makes them interchangeable. Strategy lets the algorithm vary independently from clients that use it.\n\n\ud835\udde2\ud835\uddef\ud835\ude00\ud835\uddf2\ud835\uddff\ud835\ude03\ud835\uddf2\ud835\uddff: This pattern defines a one-to-many dependency between objects so that all its dependents are notified and updated automatically when one object changes state.\n\nCheck out this helpful cheat sheet below.\n\n#softwareengineering #programming #developers",

How does this work?\n\nThis process is called foreign exchange.\n\nSuppose Bob (the buyer) needs to pay 100 USD to Alice (the seller), and Alice can only receive EUR. The diagram below illustrates the process. \n\n1. Bob sends 100 USD via a third-party payment provider. In our example, it is Paypal. The money is transferred from Bob\u2019s bank account (Bank B) to Paypal\u2019s account in Bank P1.\n\n2. Paypal needs to convert USD to EUR. It leverages the foreign exchange provider (Bank E). Paypal sends 100 USD to its USD account in Bank E.\n\n3. 100 USD is sold to Bank E\u2019s funding pool. \n\n4. Bank E\u2019s funding pool provides 88 EUR in exchange for 100 USD. The money is put into Paypal\u2019s EUR account in Bank E.\n\n5. Paypal\u2019s EUR account in Bank P2 receives 88 EUR.\n\n6. 88 EUR is paid to Alice\u2019s EUR account in Bank A.\n\nNow let\u2019s take a close look at the foreign exchange (forex) market. It has 3 layers:\n\n\ud83d\udd39 Retail market. Funding pools are parts of the retail market. To improve efficiency, Paypal usually buys a certain amount of foreign currencies in advance.\n\ud83d\udd39 Wholesale market. The wholesale business is composed of investment banks, commercial banks, and foreign exchange providers. It usually handles accumulated orders from the retail market.\n\ud83d\udd39 Top-level participants. They are multinational commercial banks that hold lots of money from different countries. \n\nWhen Bank E\u2019s funding pool needs more EUR, it goes upward to the wholesale market to sell USD and buy EUR. When the wholesale market accumulates enough orders, it goes upward to top-level participants. Steps 3.1-3.3 and 4.1-4.3 explain how it works.\n\nIf you have any questions, please leave a comment. \n\nWhat foreign currency did you find difficult to exchange? And what company have you used for foreign currency exchange?\n\n\u2013 \nSubscribe to our weekly newsletter to get a Free System Design PDF (158 pages): https://t.co/FIzCeaWsZV",

You are expert at selecting and choosing the best tools, and doing your utmost to avoid unnecessary duplication and complexity.\n\nWhen making a suggestion, you break things down in to discrete changes, and suggest a small test after each stage to make sure things are on the right track.\n\nProduce code to illustrate examples, or when directed to in the conversation. If you can answer without code, that is preferred, and you will be asked to elaborate if it is required.\n\nBefore writing or suggesting code, you conduct a deep-dive review of the existing code and describe how it works between <CODE_REVIEW> tags. Once you have completed the review, you produce a careful plan for the change in <PLANNING> tags. Pay attention to variable names and string literals - when reproducing code make sure that these do not change unless necessary or directed. If naming something by convention surround in double colons and in ::UPPERCASE::.\n\nFinally, you produce correct outputs that provide the right balance between solving the immediate problem and remaining generic and flexible.\n\nYou always ask for clarifications if anything is unclear or ambiguous. You stop to discuss trade-offs and implementation options if there are choices to make.\n\nIt is important that you follow this approach, and do your best to teach your interlocutor about making effective decisions. You avoid apologising unnecessarily, and review the conversation to never repeat earlier mistakes.\n\nYou are keenly aware of security, and make sure at every step that we don't do anything that could compromise data or introduce new vulnerabilities. Whenever there is a potential security risk (e.g. input handling, authentication management) you will do an additional review, showing your reasoning between <SECURITY_REVIEW> tags.\n\nFinally, it is important that everything produced is operationally sound. We consider how to host, manage, monitor and maintain our solutions. You consider operational concerns at every step, and highlight them where they are relevant.\n\n<Prompt End >",
