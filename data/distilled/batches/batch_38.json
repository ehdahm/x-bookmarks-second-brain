They act as temporary views executed every time they are referenced.\n\nTemporary Tables\n\nBut we also have Temporary tables, and they come with Performance through Persistence.\n\nTemporary tables store data in the database's temporary storage (e.g., the tempdb in SQL Server).\n\nOn Temporary tables, you can also define indexes!!!\n\nThis physical storage and the indexes will make the reads or joins X times faster.\n\nTL;DR:\n\nCTEs are excellent for organizing and simplifying complex SQL queries without storing intermediate results, making them easy to read and maintain.\n\nTemporary Tables are better suited for performance optimization of large datasets, indexing, and reducing the need for repeated computations.\n\nI love CTEs because of their readability, but the performance on Temporary Tables is hard to ignore for large datasets.\n\nStay curious!",

You don\u2019t have a brand; you have a product barely making $2k a month.\n\n\u2022 .com, .io, .so, .ai \u2013 in the end, no one cares.\n\n\u2022 Don\u2019t think affiliation will fix your acquisition issues. It\u2019ll just create another acquisition problem: acquiring affiliate partners.\n\n\u2022 There is no silver bullet. There isn\u2019t one thing that will grow your product from 0 to 1, but many things will grow it from 0.10 to 0.11.\n\n\u2022 If you don\u2019t know where to begin, copy what works best. That probably means emulating the best in class, not your competitors: Stripe for documentation, Amazon for conversion, Apple for copywriting. Expand your \"copy-scope\".\n\n\u2022 Once you find an acquisition channel that works, forget everything else. Every dollar spent elsewhere is a dollar that could have been spent with a guaranteed and increasing return since you\u2019ll get better at this acquisition channel.\n\n\u2022 Be the generalist, hire specialists. The best way to work with people better than you is to find those who excel at one thing. People who are good at everything will not work for you; they\u2019ll build their own company.\n\n\u2022 Never offer a plan with \u201cunlimited\u201d features. It leaves money on the table for \u201cwhale\u201d customers who could make up 70% of your revenue.\n\n\u2022 If you can\u2019t offer both a cheap plan and exceptional support, then don\u2019t offer a cheap plan. Feature-gating support means potential big customers will have a terrible experience and look elsewhere, and worse, you\u2019ll never hear from them.\n\n\u2022 There is absolutely no reason not to add Google login and any relevant social logins to your signup page.\n\n\u2022 Read all your competitors\u2019 reviews on G2/Capterra, several times per year.\n\n\u2022 It\u2019s delusional to think that if you can make it to $10k MRR, you\u2019ll magically get to $100k MRR. There's this little thing called churn you know.\n\n\u2022 If you share your success on Twitter, you will get copied, 100%. There\u2019s no way around it.\n\n\u2022 People who tell you, \u201cBuild this feature and I\u2019ll subscribe,\u201d will never subscribe to your SaaS.\n\n\u2022 \u201cThe Mom Test\u201d by Rob Fitzpatrick are the best 130 pages you\u2019ll ever read about product development.\n\n\u2022 The easiest way to sell your product when your start from 0 is to provide value to your target-demographic for free: participate in forums, engage in Facebook groups, answer on Twitter. People will like you, want to know more about you and will be open to learn about your thing.\n\n\u2022 Launching on ProductHunt is a nice baptism of fire if you\u2019ve never launched anything, but don\u2019t overthink it. It\u2019s not as impactful as it used to be.\n\n\u2022 You\u2019re probably never going to sell your SaaS for a 10x multiple. Heck you'll probably never be able to sell your SaaS at all. That doesn\u2019t mean you don\u2019t have a great asset but 2-5x multiple is what happens in real life 99% of the time.",

A nice read for your weekend.\n\n- \"The Prompt Report: A Systematic Survey of Prompting Techniques\": \u2728\n\nExplores structured understanding and taxonomy of  58 text-only prompting techniques, and 40 techniques for other modalities.\n\n\ud83d\udccc The paper focuses on discrete prefix prompts rather than cloze prompts, because prefix prompts are widely used with modern LLM architectures like decoder-only models. It excludes soft prompts and techniques using gradient-based updates.\n\n\ud83d\udccc The paper identifies 58 text-based prompting techniques broken into 6 major categories:\n\n1) In-Context Learning (ICL) - learning from exemplars/instructions in the prompt\n2) Zero-Shot - prompting without exemplars\n3) Thought Generation - prompting the LLM to articulate reasoning\n4) Decomposition - breaking down complex problems\n5) Ensembling - using multiple prompts and aggregating outputs\n6) Self-Criticism - having the LLM critique its own outputs\n\n\ud83d\udccc For ICL, it discusses key design decisions like exemplar quantity, ordering, label quality, format, and similarity that critically influence output quality. It also covers ICL techniques like K-Nearest Neighbor exemplar selection.\n\n\ud83d\udccc Extends the taxonomy to multilingual prompts, discussing techniques like translate-first prompting and cross-lingual ICL. It also covers multimodal prompts spanning image, audio, video, segmentation, and 3D modalities.\n\n\ud83d\udccc More complex techniques like agents that access external tools, code generation, and retrieval augmented generation are also taxonomized. Evaluation techniques using LLMs are discussed.\n\n\ud83d\udccc Prompting issues like security (prompt hacking), overconfidence, biases, and ambiguity are highlighted. Two case studies - benchmarking techniques on MMLU and an entrapment detection prompt engineering exercise - are presented.",
