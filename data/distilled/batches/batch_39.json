It allows the human reviewer no reason to reject you.\n\n2. It equips the AI Applicant Tracking System (ATS) to rate you favorably.\n\n3. It stands out to the company, that you went the extra mile.\n\nHere\u2019s how:\n\n1. Ask yourself, \u201cwhat are my weaknesses?\u201d\n\nNo one who gets hired is a perfect fit.\n\nIn what ways are you imperfect?\n\nFlip them to strengths.\n\nFor example, let\u2019s say you\u2019re applying to an AI PM job.\n\nYou want to highlight every last AI project you ever worked on.\n\nTry not to get chosen over someone with more AI experience.\n\n2. Become an ideal archetype\n\nThe process to flipping to strengths is two-fold:\n\n> Figure out some ideal archetypes that they would hire\n\n> Cast yourself as the one that is closest to you\n\nNote: This strategy only works if you are \u2265 75% qualified for the job.\n\nIf you\u2019re just unqualified, there\u2019s not going to be an ethical way to become an archetype.\n\nIf you still want to apply, do your best to explain around weaknesses and be pointy in other areas.\n\n3. Write out your new story\n\nThis should be a fairly straight path to the role.\n\nAll those experiences on your winding path that aren\u2019t relevant?\n\nMinimize\u2014or even remove\u2014them.\n\nThis usually means: tough cuts to favorite parts of your resume.\n\nBut you need the space to tell your story of how you\u2019ve flipped your weaknesses. Holding onto other flourishes is going to distract from your story.\n\nRemember: most people spend <60 seconds on your resume.\n\n4. Fill in for all the bullets on the job description (JD)\n\nEvery JD has a long list of requirements.\n\nUse every bullet you didn\u2019t touch in step 3 to address all those points.\n\nOnce you\u2019ve done these 4 steps, your resume should be transformed.\n\nFirst, you were a generic candidate. Now, you are exactly the set of skills and experiences they were looking for. \n\nAnd you\u2019ll get many more interviews. Through resume drops, cold emails, and referrals.\n\nWant to learn more about customizing your resume?\n\nCheck out this deep-dive with 2 examples:\nhttps://t.co/A8ugOP1fsm",

Where do we want to go\n2. How will we get there\n3. What problems should we solve to get there\n4. Are all important people on the same page\n5. What solutions to build? How to deliver on time?\n6. How do we know we're making progress\n\nLet's understand in detail:\n\nWhere Do We Want to Go\nA PM must create a clear vision so the entire team knows the destination.\n\nBuild a deep understanding of the market, customer needs, and company\u2019s goals. Regularly communicate the vision to ensure everyone knows it, agrees with it, and remembers it.\n\nEvery successful product starts with a clear and ambitious vision\n\nHow Will We Get There\nA PM needs to create a strategy to reach the vision.\n\nIn the strategy, a PM should define what to focus on, what to avoid, target users, market trends, and strengths/weaknesses. Then, collaborate with teams to refine this strategy and adjust based on feedback and market changes.\n\nA well-defined strategy is crucial success.\n\nWhat Problems Should We Solve to Get There\nPrioritizing the right problems is the only way to create value for the users.\n\nUnderstand user's real needs and pains, prioritize the critical ones that align with the vision. Do this continuously, not just annually.\n\nAre All Important People On The Same Page\nEnsure everyone is aligned to make true progress.\n\nCommunicate proactively and transparently. Involve relevant people in decisions, and iterate based on feedback. Regularly check if they're still aligned.\n\nNon-aligned teams move in different directions, slowing down progress\n\nWhat Solutions To Build? How To Deliver On Time?\nIdentify and develop the right solutions, deliver them on time.\n\nBrainstorm the best solutions and build those with the highest impact on the user. Deliver on time to maximise impact.\n\nUsers will use (and love) your product if solves their problems\n\nHow Do We Know We're Making Progress\nIt is not progress, if it can't be measured.\n\nCreate clear metrics and success criteria. Review progress regularly to measure success / failure. When off track, adjust your roadmap or your goals or both. With every success / failure, ensure you learn and get better.\n\nMeasuring success keeps everyone focused and accountable.\n--\nWhat was your definition of the PM's role when you started and how has it changed since then?",
